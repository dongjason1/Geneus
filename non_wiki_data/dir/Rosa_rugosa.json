    "__SUMMARY__": "Well-known for its incredible hardiness and legendary disease resistance, Rosa rugosa, commonly known as rugosa Rose or Japanese Rose, is rich of many virtues and can be relied on to provide interest and color. Parent to many shrub roses, this is a vigorous, tough, prickly, sprawling, suckering shrub that is amazingly tolerant of dry sandy soils, salt spray and wind. It is covered with a plentiful array of remarkably fragrant, single, small pink flowers with yellow central stamens from early summer through the end of the growing season. Flowering is so profuse that the attractive blossoms nearly cover the handsome, glossy, wrinkled, heavily veined, rich green foliage. As an extra bonus, these are followed by large, edible fruits that are as pretty as the flowers themselves. Resembling cherry tomatoes, the striking orangish-red rose-hips, provide a beautiful contrast against the foliage which turns golden-yellow or bronze in fall, adding interest and color to the fall garden. The rose hips may also be used to make jams and jellies. If left on the shrub, they might persist into winter to the delight of hungry birds who will feast on the large and colorful hips during the winter months. "
