    "__SUMMARY__": "Aloe bakeri is a species of flowering plant in the family Asphodelaceae, native to Madagascar. Growing to 10–20 cm (4–8 in) tall by 40 cm (16 in) wide, it is an evergreen perennial forming multiple rosettes of spidery succulent green or reddish-green toothed leaves, heavily mottled with white. In summer it produces red or orange, green-tipped tubular flowers.The Latin specific epithet bakeri honours one of two British horticulturalists, in this case John Gilbert Baker of Kew (1834-1920).With a minimum temperature of 10 °C (50 °F), this plant requires winter heat, and in temperate regions is cultivated under glass. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\n\n== References =="
