    "__SUMMARY__": "Hieracium attenboroughianum, or Attenborough’s hawkweed, is a species of hawkweed in the genus Hieracium, found only in the Brecon Beacons in south Wales. It was named after the naturalist Sir David Attenborough by taxonomist Tim Rich, who said:\nI decided to name this special little plant after David Attenborough as he inspired me to study ecology when I was 17. This is a personal thank you for the years of fascination he has given me going to different places to search for new things.\n\nRich was one of the team that first discovered the species, in 2004.The species is classified is a member of the H. britannicum group in Hieracium section Stelligera Zahn. It is related to H. britannicoides (P. D. Sell), but differs in having in cupped, dark green leaves and sparse, medium simple eglandular hairs and many glandular hairs on the involucral bracts.Only around 300 plants occur on Old Red Sandstone mountain ledges on Cribyn.\n\n\n== References =="
