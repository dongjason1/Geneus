    "__SUMMARY__": "Pilosella albiflora (synonym Hieracium albiflorum) is a common and widespread North American plant in the sunflower family, known by the names white hawkweed and white-flowered hawkweed.\nPilosella albiflora grows in western North America, from Alaska and Northwest Territories south as far as Chihuahua, Sonora) and east to Manitoba and the Black Hills of South Dakota. There have been reports of populations in Québec and Wisconsin, but these are probably waifs or introductions.Pilosella albiflora  is found in forests and woodlands at low to moderate elevation. It is similar its relative the common dandelion, except for having more than one flower head per plant, sometimes 50 or more in a flat-topped array. Each head has 6-25 white (rather than yellow as in most related species) ray flowers but no disc flowers.",
