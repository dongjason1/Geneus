    "__SUMMARY__": "Pilosella scouleri (synonym Hieracium scouleri) is a North American species of flowering plant in the dandelion tribe within the sunflower family. It is known as Scouler's woollyweed. It is native to western North America, from British Columbia and Alberta in Canada, south to northern California and Utah in the United States.Pilosella scouleri grows in a variety of mountainous habitats. It produces a basal rosette of long, narrow leaves 10–20 centimetres (3.9–7.9 in) long, which are generally hairy to bristly. The plant produces an erect stem 30–70 centimetres (12–28 in) tall which bears the inflorescence. Each flower head has large, curling bracts with glandular hairs or bristles, long, bright yellow ray florets but no disc florets. The achene is about 3 millimetres (0.12 in) long.",
