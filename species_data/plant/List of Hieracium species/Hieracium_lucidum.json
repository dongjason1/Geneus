    "__SUMMARY__": "Hieracium lucidum, or Sicilian sparviere, is a flowering plant in the aster family. It is very similar to Hieracium cophanense. Hieracium lucidum is a perennial herb that prefers the northern slopes of calcareous seaside cliffs exposed to humid winds; sites rich in nitrates from sea bird droppings. Unlike most other Hieracium, this species reproduces only from seeds.",
    "Distribution": "Hieracium lucidum is found only in Italy; its range is limited to Mt. Gallo, near Palermo (Sicily). Due to the extremely limited area in which it is found, which is estimated to be 0.2 km2 (0.1 sq mi), the species is listed by IUCN as critically endangered.Its natural habitats are Mediterranean-type shrubby vegetation and rocky shores.",
