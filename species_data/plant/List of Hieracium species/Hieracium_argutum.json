The plant grows 60 centimeters to one meter tall.\nThe deeply toothed leaves are covered in long hairs. The largest leaves at the base of the stem may reach 16 centimeters. There may be shorter leaves on the lower part of the stem and there are few or none on the upper part.\nThe inflorescence is a wide open array of many flower heads, each up to about a centimeter wide. The flower head is lined with hairy, often glandular phyllaries and filled with many yellow ray florets and no disc florets.\nThe fruit is a small, dark cylindrical achene topped with a pappus of brown bristles.",
