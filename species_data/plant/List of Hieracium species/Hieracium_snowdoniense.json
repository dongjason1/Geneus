    "__SUMMARY__": "Hieracium snowdoniense, the Snowdonia hawkweed, is a plant endemic to Snowdonia, North Wales. It is a perennial, with bright yellow inflorescences.\nIt was believed to have become extinct in the early 1950s as a result of overgrazing. In 2002, the plant was re-discovered on steep slopes in the Cwm Idwal National Nature Reserve above Bethesda.",
