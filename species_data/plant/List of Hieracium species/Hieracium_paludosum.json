    "__SUMMARY__": "Crepis paludosa, the marsh hawk's-beard, is a European species of plants in the dandelion tribe within the sunflower family. It is widespread across much of Europe with isolated populations in Iceland, the Ural Mountains, and the Caucasus.Crepis paludosa is found beside shady burns, and in other damp shady places. The inflorescence is around 15–25 millimetres (0.6–1.0 in) in diameter. The upper leaves of marsh hawksbeard clasp the stem with pair of rounded basal lobes. The plant is perennial.  It is a much more robust plant than smooth hawksbeard, Crepis capillaris, with which it is sometimes confused. Flower heads are yellow and the flower buds are covered with black gland-hairs.",
    "Conservation": "Crepis paludosa is a component of Purple moor grass and rush pastures -  a type of Biodiversity Action Plan habitat in the UK. It occurs on poorly drained neutral and acidic soils of the lowlands and upland fringe. It is found in the South West of England, especially in Devon.",
