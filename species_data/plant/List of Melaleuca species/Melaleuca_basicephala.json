The leaves are in alternating opposite pairs (decussate) and are 8–12.5 mm (0.3–0.5 in) long, 1.8–2.5 mm (0.07–0.1 in) wide, oval or tear-drop shaped and glabrous.The flowers are in heads on the previous year's shoots in groups of two to ten, the heads up to 10 mm (0.4 in) in diameter. The stamens are in five bundles around the flower, each bundle with 17 to 23 pinkish-purple or mauve-pink stamens. Flowering occurs from November to February. The fruits are 3 mm (0.1 in) long.",
