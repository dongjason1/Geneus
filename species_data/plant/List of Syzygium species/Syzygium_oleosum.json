    "__SUMMARY__": "Syzygium oleosum, commonly known as the blue lilly pilly, is a species of Syzygium tree native to eastern Australian rainforests and wet sclerophyll forests. It is usually a small tree, 4 to 15 m tall. The leaves are opposite, simple and lanceolate to ovate, with a dark glossy upper surface and paler under-surface. The leaves have oil dots and are distinctly aromatic when crushed, with aromas reminiscent of mango or apricot. Its flowers are small and white-cream colored. It produces a purplish red fruit when young, changing to purplish blue when ripe, 13–40 mm in diameter.The fruit can be eaten freshly picked from the tree or cooked. It has a pleasantly crisp texture and is mildly aromatic and sweet. The fruit can also be made into jams, jellies and wine. It is also grown as an ornamental plant.\n\n\n== References =="
