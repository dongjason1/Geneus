It can attain a height of up to 35 m with a trunk diameter of 60 cm. In cultivation, this species is usually a small to medium-sized tree with a maximum height of only 18m.",
    "Description": "The leaves are opposite, simple, lanceolate from 4–8 cm long. Flowers are white and in clusters. The dark pink to red fruits are edible.This species is commonly confused with magenta cherry and the blue lilly pilly. However, the brush cherry has a paler trunk.",
    "Distribution": "The species occurs in coastal regions in Queensland and New South Wales, northwards from Batemans Bay.",
    "Cultivation and Uses": "Brush cherry is commonly cultivated in gardens in eastern Australia, mostly as shorter, shrub-like cultivars such as \"Aussie Boomer\", \"Aussie Compact\", \"Birdsville\", \"Bush Christmas\", \"Minipilly\" and \"Tiny Trev\". These are especially popular as hedges.\nThe pleasantly sour fruit are also eaten fresh or cooked. The fruit can be used to make jams and jellies.\nThis species has been adopted by Coffs Harbour City Council as the City's floral emblem.Outside Australia, brush cherry is used as a subject for bonsai.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== References =="
