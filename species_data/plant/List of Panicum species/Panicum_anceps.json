It is native to the southeastern United States, where it occurs as far north as New Jersey and as far west as Kansas and Texas.This species is a rhizomatous perennial grass with stems growing up to 1.3 meters tall. The leaves have erect blades up to half a meter tall. The inflorescence is a panicle up to 40 centimeters long bearing pale green or yellowish spikelets. The grass produces an abundance of seed. The seed is curved like the beak of a bird, giving the plant its common name.In the wild this plant grows in moist areas such as swampland and wet woodland habitat.This grass provides a good graze for cattle and horses throughout most of the year.
