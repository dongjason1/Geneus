The inflorescence is composed of up to 10 racemes, each up to 7 centimeters long.

    "Diseases and pests": "This grass is susceptible to the maize streak virus (MSV), which is transmitted by Cicadulina leafhoppers such as Cicadulina mbila, C. arachidis, C. triangula, C. bimaculata, C. similis, C. latens, C ghaurii, and C. parazeae. \nIt is also susceptible to cereal chlorotic mottle virus, which is transmitted by several insects, including Nesoclutha pallida and Cicadula bimaculata.",
    "Common names": "Common names for the grass include barajalgauti, basaunta (Punjabi), tuinheesgras, heesgras, kurimanna (Afrikaans), sharp-flowered signal-grass, annual signal grass, garden signal grass, panic liverseed grass, herringbone grass (English), kuri millet (in Zimbabwe), pasto africano (Italian), farsho (Somali), kgolane, and bore-ba-ntjia (Sotho).\n\n\n== References =="
