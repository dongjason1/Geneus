    "__SUMMARY__": "Eucalyptus rigens, commonly known as saltlake mallee or blue salt mallee, is a tree that is native to Western Australia.The mallee typically grows to a height of 1 to 4 metres (3 to 13 ft) and has a sprawling habit. The bark of the tree is smooth and grey-brown in colour and peels in strips. It blooms between July and September producing inflorescences with white-yellow flowers.The species was first formally described by the botanists Ian Brooker and Stephen Hopper in 1989 as part of the work A new series Rigentes, of Eucalyptus (Myrtaceae) comprising three new species endemic to Western Australia published in the journal Nuytsia.The salt tolerant species is found around salt lakes in the Goldfields-Esperance region between Esperance and Norseman where it grows in sandy soils.",
