    "__SUMMARY__": "Eucalyptus websteriana, commonly known as Webster's mallee, heart-leaf mallee or dainty mallee, is a mallee that is native to the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia.",
    "Description": "The mallee typically grows to a height of around 4 to 5 metres (13 to 16 ft) and has a spreading habit and minni ritchi type bark. It can form a lignotuber and has red-brown coloured bark on the trunk and branches. The leaves have a distinctive heart shape and the small, compact tree only provides lightly dappled shade, which benefits plants in the undergrowth as the tree grows. It blooms between September and November producing inflorescences with yellow flowers.",
    "Taxonomy": "It resembles Eucalyptus orbifolia with both having a similar leaf-shape, and is also closely related to Eucalyptus ewartiana and Eucalyptus crucis.\nThe specific epithet honours Leonard Clarke Webster, the collector of the type specimen, who was a pharmacist and doctor who lived in Kalgoorlie and sold botanical specimens to the British Museum of Natural History.",
    "Distribution": "It is found on rocky rises in the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia in an area centred around Kalgoorlie. Its range extends to the western fringe of the Great Victoria Desert to the east of Cosmo Newberry down to around Kambalda and Norseman in the south west where it grows in rocky soils.",
