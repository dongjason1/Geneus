    "__SUMMARY__": "Eucalyptus wimmerensis, commonly known as the Wimmera mallee box or the broad-leaved green mallee, is a mallee that is native to South Australia.\nThe multi stemmed and often erect mallee typically grows to height of 12 metres (39 ft) and has rough bark on the trunk and smooth, grey to tan to cream bark above or is smooth throughout. Adult leaves are glossy and green and have a blade that is 80 millimetres (3.1 in) long and 15 mm (0.6 in) wide with a linear-lanceolate to narrow-lanceolate shape. Flowers are axillary and form in groups of 7-11 with buds that are 6 mm (0.24 in) long and 4 mm (0.16 in) wide. Flowers are white in colour and bloom between November and April. It will then form a barrel-shaped fruit that is 6 mm (0.24 in) long with the same width.It has a distribution that is localised around Bordertown in the south east in South Australia, where it grows in sandy soils or gravelly loams in mallee vegetation or mixed mallee woodland. It is also found in north west Victoria scattered in the areas around Dimboola, Nhill, Kaniva area (including the Little Desert) south to around Mount Arapiles. As with some other Eucalypts, it occurs in lands cleared for agriculture that have been modified by clearing as a result regrowth in these areas can be notoriously difficult, some stands of E. wimmerensis include hybrids, even with the distantly related mallees of the Eucalyptus dumosa group.",
