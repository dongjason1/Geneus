    "__SUMMARY__": "Eucalyptus subtilis, commonly known as narrow-leaved mallee, is a mallee that is native to Western Australia.The mallee typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 metres (3 to 10 ft) and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth grey to light pale orange coloured bark. The erect alternately arranged adult leaves have glossy green linear leaf blades that are 4.5 to 8 cm (1.8 to 3.1 in) in length and 0.4 to 0.7 cm (0.16 to 0.28 in) wide with a pointed apex and the base tapering toward the petiole. It blooms between February and June, producing inflorescences with white flowers.The species was first formally described by the botanists Ian Brooker and [[Stephen Hopper in 1991 as part of the work A taxonomic revision of Eucalyptus wandoo, E. redunca and allied species (Eucalyptus series Levispermae Maiden - Myrtaceae) in Western Australia as published in the journal Nuytsia. The specific epithet is taken from the Latin word subtilis meaning fine or delicate in reference to the leaves of the species.It is found on sandplains and rises in an area between Lake Grace and Norseman in the eastern Wheatbelt and western Goldfields region, where it grows in sandy-clay-loam soils.",
