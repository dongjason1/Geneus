    "__SUMMARY__": "Eucalyptus percostata, commonly known as the rib-capped mallee or Devils peak mallee, is a species of mallee that is endemic to South Australia. It has smooth bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, creamy white flowers and cup-shaped to conical fruit. It is only known from a few locations in the Flinders Ranges.",
    "Description": "Eucalyptus percostata is a mallee that typically grows to a height of 3–10 m (9.8–32.8 ft) and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth whitish bark that is coppery when new. Young plants and coppice regrowth have broadly lance-shaped to broadly egg-shaped leaves that are 50–100 mm (2.0–3.9 in) long and 30–60 mm (1.2–2.4 in) wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of green on both sides, lance-shaped, 70–120 mm (2.8–4.7 in) long and 12–25 mm (0.47–0.98 in) wide tapering to a petiole 10–22 mm (0.39–0.87 in) long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils on a peduncle 8–20 mm (0.31–0.79 in) long, the individual buds sessile or on pedicels up to 2 mm (0.079 in) long. Mature buds are pear-shaped, 8–12 mm (0.31–0.47 in) long and 6–7 mm (0.24–0.28 in) wide with a conspicuously ribbed, rounded to conical operculum. Flowering from May to September and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped to conical capsule 6–8 mm (0.24–0.31 in) long and 5–9 mm (0.20–0.35 in) wide with the valves near rim level.",
    "Taxonomy": "Eucalyptus percostata was first formally described in 1990 by Ian Brooker and Peter Lang in Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens from material collected on a track east of Devils Peak, near Quorn in 1986.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Rib-capped mallee grows in woodland and mallee in the southern Flinders Ranges between Quorn and Napperby.",
