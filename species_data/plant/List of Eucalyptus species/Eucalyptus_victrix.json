    "Description": "The spreading tree typically grows to a height of 1 to 12 metres (3 to 39 ft) but can reach as high as 22 m (72 ft). It has smooth bark often with a box-type stocking of rougher bark at the base to a height of 1 m (3 ft). It blooms between November and March producing round white-cream flowers. The tree has an open pendula habit and is slow growing. The small glaucous lanceolate shaped blue-green leaves are covered with a white, waxy bloom.
