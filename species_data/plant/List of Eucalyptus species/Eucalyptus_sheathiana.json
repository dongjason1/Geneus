    "__SUMMARY__": "Eucalyptus sheathiana, commonly known as ribbon barked gum, is a tree, sometimes a mallee that is native to Western Australia. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 15 metres (10 to 49 ft) and has smooth bark that peels off in long thin ribbons. It blooms between January and April producing inflorescences with white flowers and is found on plains in the Wheatbelt and Goldfields-Esperance regions where it grows in sandy lateritic soils.",
