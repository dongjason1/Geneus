    "__SUMMARY__": "Eucalyptus terebra, commonly known as Balladonia gimlet, is a eucalypt that is native to Western Australia.The tree or sometimes mallee typically grows to a height of 2.5 to 12 metres (8 to 39 ft). It has a fluted stem and satiny to glossy, dark grey to orange, green-brown smooth bark. The glossy green adult leaves are arranged alternately, the leaf blade has a linear to narrowly lanceolate shape and is 6 to 9.5 centimetres (2 to 4 in) long and 0.5 to 1.2 cm (0.20 to 0.47 in) wide. </ref> It blooms in November producing yellow flowers. The unbranched axillary inflorescences have ovoid to globular mature buds with lemon yellow flowers. These will form sessile fruits with a obconical to hemispherical shape which are 0.3 to 0.6 cm (0.12 to 0.24 in) long and 0.9 to 1.3 cm (0.35 to 0.51 in) across with four exserted valves. The fruits contain pale to light ovoid brown seeds that are  1 to 2 millimetres (0.039 to 0.079 in) in length.E. terebra grows in flat areas in the southern part of the Goldfields-Esperance region in calcerous loam or sandy soils. It is distributed through the Coolgardie, Nullarbor and Mallee IBRA regions.\nE. terebra  is one of the six true gimlet species that have buds in groups of seven. The other true gimlets are E. campaspe , E. effusa , E. salubris, E. ravida and E. tortilis.The species name is from the Latin word meaning gimlet or borer, in reference to the common name of the group of Eucalypts it is a part of.",
