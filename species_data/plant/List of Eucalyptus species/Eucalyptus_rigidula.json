    "__SUMMARY__": "Eucalyptus rigidula, commonly known as stiff-leaved mallee, is a mallee that is native to Western Australia.",
    "Description": "The mallee typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 5 metres (5 to 16 ft). The bark of the tree is smooth and white-grey brown in colour and peels in ribbony strips at the base. It blooms between December and April producing inflorescences with white flowers. The bark is smooth and powdery with no pith of bark glands. The disjunct, glossy, green or yellow-green adult leaves have a lanceolate to broad lanceolate shaped blade that is basally tapered. The thick concolorous blade is 5 to 9 centimetres (2.0 to 3.5 in) in length and 0.8 to 1.8 cm (0.31 to 0.71 in) wide. The leaves are supported by terete, narrowly flattened or channelled petioles that are 0.8 to 1.6 cm (0.31 to 0.63 in) long. The simple axillary conflorescences have seven flowered umbellasters on terete peduncles that are 5 to 12 mm (0.20 to 0.47 in) long. The buds have an ovoid or fusiform shape and are neither glaucous or pruinose Each bud is 8 to 10 mm (0.31 to 0.39 in) in length with a 3 to 4 mm (0.12 to 0.16 in) diameter with a calyx calyptrate that sheds early. the fruits that form are hemispherical or ovoid in shape.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was first formally described by the botanist Joseph Maiden in 1928 as part of the work A Critical Revision of the Genus Eucalyptus. The only synonym is Eucalyptus angusta also described by Maiden. The type specimen was collected by Maiden in 1909 from near Comet Vale.",
    "Distribution": "It is found on undulating sand plains in the Mid West, Wheatbelt and Goldfields-Esperance regions where it grows in yellow or red sandy soils.",
