    "__SUMMARY__": "Eucalyptus largiflorens, or black box, is a tree that is endemic to Australia. It has rough, fibrous or flaky bark, dull greenish-grey, lance-shaped leaves, oval to club-shaped green to yellow flower buds, white flowers and hemispherical, cup-shaped or barrel-shaped fruit.",
    "Description": "Eucalyptus largiflorens is a tree that grows to a height of 20 metres (66 ft) with rough bark to the thinnest branches. The bark is dark grey and fibrous or flaky, sometimes furrowed on the trunk. The leaves on young trees are dull greyish green to bluish, linear to narrow lance-shaped, 40–155 mm (2–6 in) long and 4–18 mm (0.2–0.7 in) wide. Adult leaves are lance-shaped, the same shade of green on both sides, 60–180 mm (2–7 in) long and 8–20 mm (0.3–0.8 in) wide. The flowers are arranged in groups of mostly between seven and eleven on the ends of the branches or in leaf axils on a cylindrical peduncle 3–11 mm (0.12–0.43 in) long, individual flowers on a cylindrical pedicel 1–5 mm (0.039–0.20 in) long. The mature buds are green to yellow, oval to club-shaped, 4–5 mm (0.16–0.20 in) long and 2–3 mm (0.079–0.12 in) wide. The operculum is hemispherical to cone-shaped, shorter and narrower than the flower cup. The stamens are white. Flowering occurs in most months but especially in autumn and spring. The fruit is a hemispherical to oval capsule, 3–6 mm (0.1–0.2 in) long and 3–5 mm (0.1–0.2 in) wide.",
    "Taxonomy": "Eucalyptus largiflorens was first formally described in 1855 by Ferdinand von Mueller and the description was published in Transactions and Prodeedings of the Victorian Institute for the Advancement of Science. The specific epithet (largiflorens) is derived from the Latin words largus meaning \"abundant\" and florens meaning \"blooming\", referring to the size of the inflorescence.",
    "Distribution": "The black box is widespread in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, especially in grassy woodland on the floodplains of the Murray–Darling basin, but usually in dryer sites than river red gum (E. camaldulensis).",
