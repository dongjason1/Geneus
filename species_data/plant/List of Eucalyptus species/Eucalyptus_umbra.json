    "__SUMMARY__": "Eucalyptus umbra, known as the Broad-leaved white mahogany, is a common eucalyptus tree of the high rainfall coastal areas of New South Wales and adjacent areas in south eastern Queensland. The bark is rough, resembling a stringybark, though not as coarse, and in flat strips. Thick, fibrous bark, greyish brown in colour. A small or medium-sized tree, up to 35 metres tall. Sometimes a shrub in the poorer skeletal soils.\nE. umbra is part of the white mahogany group as recognised by Ken Hill, others in the group include; Eucalyptus acmenoides, Eucalyptus mediocris, Eucalyptus carnea, Eucalyptus apothalassica, Eucalyptus helidonica, Eucalyptus psammitica and Eucalyptus latisinensis.This tree occurs in dry sclerophyll forest or woodland, usually on poor shallow dry soils; north from Port Jackson. The type was collected from near Mosman, New South Wales.",
