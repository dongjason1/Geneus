    "__SUMMARY__": "Eucalyptus stricta, commonly known as Blue Mountains mallee ash, is a small eucalyptus plant mostly seen growing in the Blue Mountains region in central eastern New South Wales. A mallee grows up to 5 metres tall, but is usually seen much smaller. It is a common plant in poorly drained, shallow sandy soils, in areas frequented by fire. The narrow leaves and multistemmed mallee habit make this plant easily noticed in the Blue Mountains.\n\n\n== References =="
