    "__SUMMARY__": "Eucalyptus rubida, commonly known as Candlebark Gum or simply Candlebark, is a medium-sized eucalypt.  It occurs in south-eastern Australia and Tasmania, typically in open woodland around the lower slopes of the Great Dividing Range, but also in taller forests. The subspecies barbigerorum, found in localities in New South Wales, is listed as vulnerable. The common name of E. rubida subsp. barbigerorum is blackbutt candlebark. Companion species include Eucalyptus pauciflora, Eucalyptus melliodora and Eucalyptus bridgesiana.",
    "Description": "The bark is generally smooth and white, with unshaded limbs often turning red or orange in the summer. The trunk of the tree often has a ragged base where the old layers of bark have not fallen away, giving the appearance of a stubby candle, and the tree its name. The bark of the trunk is also often cut with horizontal marks made by a burrowing beetle.",
