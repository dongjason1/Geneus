    "__SUMMARY__": "Eucalyptus stricklandii, commonly known as Strickland's gum, is a tree that is native to Western Australia.\nA tree of 20 to 30 feet, with a light brown bark covered with grey flakes which peel off. The branches are very widely spreading or even drooping. The young branches are covered with a white powder, and the leaves are large, thick, and of a blue-green colour, usually above six inches long. The flowers are very handsome, being of a bright yellow, and one and a-half inches across. The buds are blunt, nearly half an inch long, and the fruits are distinctly bell-shaped, half an inch long, and as broad, clustered at the end of a broad flat stalk. The tree occurs to the south of Coolgardie and near Norseman, and is found on gravelly hills. — Charles Lane-Poole, Primer of Forestry. 1922",
