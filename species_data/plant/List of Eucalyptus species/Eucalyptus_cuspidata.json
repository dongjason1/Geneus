In 1867, George Bentham listed it in Flora Australiensis as a synonym of Eucalyptus incrassata var. angulosa occurring in Western Australia as did Joseph Maiden in A Critical Revision of the Genus Eucalyptus. In 1988, George Chippendale listed it in Flora of Australia as a synonym of Eucalyptus angulosa. Nevertheless, it is an accepted name by the Australian Plant Census.It grows on plains and on the edges of seasonal swamps in the Esperance Plains biogeographic region.",
