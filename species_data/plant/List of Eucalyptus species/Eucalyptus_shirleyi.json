    "__SUMMARY__": "Eucalyptus shirleyi, commonly known as Shirley's silver leafed ironbark, is a eucalypt that is native to Queensland.",
    "Description": "The small tree typically grows to a height of 4 to 7 metres (13 to 23 ft) and usually has a crooked trunk. The bark is dark grey to black in colour usually rough and deeply fissured. Adult leaves are opposite, and bluish in colour with an orbicular or broadly lanceolate shape. The leaves are stalkless, stem-clasping or heart-shaped at the base. The blade is 5 to 9 centimetres (1.97 to 3.54 in) long and 2.5 to 8 cm (0.98 to 3.15 in) wide with new growth a silver to blue-grey colour.The tree blooms between March and May producing creamy yellow flowers that are about 2 cm (0.79 in) in diameter and appear in clusters of three to seven with several clusters forming panicles. Fruits form later in the form of capsules that are egg-shaped, bluish in colour, usually ribbed, with a length of 7 to 12 millimetres (0.28 to 0.47 in) and a width of 6 to 10 mm (0.24 to 0.39 in) and with enclosed valves.",
