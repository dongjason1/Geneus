    "__SUMMARY__": "Eucalyptus zopherophloia is a mallee tree that is native to the west coast of Western Australia.",
    "Description": "The mallee has a spreading habit and typically grows to a height of 2.5 metres (8 ft) to 6 metres (20 ft) high. It has rough and fibrous bark over the trunk and branches. The mallee blooms between October and January producing inflorescences with cream-white flowers. The bark is persistent on lower trunk and has a fibrous-flaky texture with white coloured box-type patches but is mostly grey to grey-black or grey with pith glands present. The semi-glossy, green, thick and concolorous adult leaves have a disjunct arrangement. The leaf blade has a narrow lanceolate or lanceolate shape and is basally attenuate. The blade is 6 to 9 centimetres (2.4 to 3.5 in) in length with a width of 0.9 to 2.1 millimetres (0.04 to 0.08 in).",
