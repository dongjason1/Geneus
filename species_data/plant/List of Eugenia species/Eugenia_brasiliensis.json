    "__SUMMARY__": "Eugenia brasiliensis, with common names Brazil cherry and grumichama, is medium-sized tree (maximum 20 meters height) endemic to Brazil which bears small fruits that are purple to black in color, and have a sweet cherry-like flavor. Its small size favors its use in urban landscaping. Its slow growth and low rate of dispersal make it rare, and it is generally considered as an endangered species.",
