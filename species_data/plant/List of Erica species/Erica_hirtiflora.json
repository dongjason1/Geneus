    "__SUMMARY__": "Erica hirtiflora (or the hairy-flower heath) is a species of Erica that was naturally restricted to the south-western corner of the Western Cape, South Africa around the city of Cape Town.\nIt produces flowers at any time of year - and in such quantities that the whole bush turns pink. Consequently, it is becoming a popular ornamental plant for Capetonian gardens.",
