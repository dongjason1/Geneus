    "__SUMMARY__": "Erica terminalis, the Corsican heath or upright heath, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae, native to southern Europe and northern Africa, and naturalised elsewhere. It is a bushy evergreen shrub, sometimes described as a tree heath (a term also applied to E. arborea and E. lusitanica). It grows to 1 m (3 ft 3 in) tall and wide, with mid-green leaves and rose-pink flowers in summer and autumn, which often persist on the plant well into winter.\n\n\n== References =="
