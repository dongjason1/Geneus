    "__SUMMARY__": "Hypericum tetrapetalum, the fourpetal St. Johnswort, is a species of flowering plant in the St. John's wort family, Hypericaceae. It is found in the Southeastern United States and Cuba. It was first described by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in 1797.",
    "Description": "Fourpetal St. Johnswort is a perennial herb or small shrub with a woody base, growing 20–100 cm (7.9–39.4 in) tall. Young stems are two- or four-lined, becoming two-lined or terete as they age. The leaves are oblong to triangular-ovate, 5–35 mm (0.20–1.38 in) long, 4–15 mm (0.16–0.59 in) across, with heart-shaped, clasping bases. The terminal flowerheads produce one to three flowers, each flower 20–30 mm (0.79–1.18 in) in diameter with 4 bright yellow petals and about 100 stamens. It produces flowers throughout most of the year. The capsules are three-parted.It is distinguished from the closely related Hypericum crux-andreae by its broader leaves with clasping bases. Their distribution overlaps in southern Georgia and northern Florida, but apparent hybrids have not been observed.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "In the United States, H. tetrapetalum is found in Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. It is also found in western Cuba.\nH. tetrapetalum occurs in wet pinelands and ditches in sandy soil.\n\n\n== References =="
