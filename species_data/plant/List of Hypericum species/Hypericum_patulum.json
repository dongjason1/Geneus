The stems are 4-lined or 4-angled when the plant is young but later become 2-lined, and sometimes become terete. The leaves are thick and paper-like and are rather glaucous, with short laminar glands, streaks, and dots. Its inflorescence is 1-15-flowered that blossom from 1 or 2 nodes. The flowers are flat-topped, and sometimes have a short terminal internode and branches that come from the middle of the stem. The petals are a golden yellow color, without any tinge of red.
