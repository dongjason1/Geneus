    "__SUMMARY__": "Hypericum forrestii is a species of flowering plant in the family Hypericaceae native to China and Myanmar. It is known as Forrest's tutsan and Forrest's St. John's wort. It was named in honour of George Forrest (1873-1932), who discovered it.",
    "Description": "It is a semi-evergreen shrub growing to 1.2 m (4 ft) tall by 1.5 m (5 ft) broad. It has oval leaves which turn red in autumn and bowl-shaped yellow flowers with prominent stamens in late summer.",
    "Distribution": "Forrest's St. John's wort is native to Yunnan and Sichuan provinces in China, and northeastern Myanmar. It has been recorded as a garden escape in locations in the British Isles, and as an invasive species. It may be under-recorded due to confusion with other St. John's wort species such as Hypericum 'Hidcote'.",
    "Cultivation": "This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\n\n== References =="
