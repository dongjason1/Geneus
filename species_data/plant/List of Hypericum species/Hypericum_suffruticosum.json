The leaf edge (margin) is flat or slightly recurved.A single flower is produced in each inflorescence. Each flower is on a pedicel 5 to 12 mm (0.20 to 0.47 in) long, recurved or reflexed at maturity. Each flower is 10 to 15 mm (0.39 to 0.59 in) in diameter with 4 sepals, 4 pale yellow petals, and approximately 30 stamens. The ovary is two parted.",
