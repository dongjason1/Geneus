The thin trailing stems have two raised lines and bear opposite pairs of pale green elongated oval leaves, often with tiny translucent glands. The undersides of the leaves have tiny black dots on the edges. The flowers are about 1 cm (0.3 in) across and grow from the leaf axils. There are five sepals of unequal size and five yellow petals, often with a few black dots, and not much larger in size than the sepals. The stamens are united at the base into bundles. The fruits are dry.",
