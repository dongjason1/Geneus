    "__SUMMARY__": "Hypericum hirsutum is a flowering plant in the genus Hypericum commonly known as hairy St John's-wort. It is found in Western Europe.",
    "Description": "Hypericum hirsutum is a downy perennial plant that grows to two or three feet. It has erect stems and opposite pairs of untoothed, elongated oval leaves with translucent glandular dots. The terminal inflorescences have many pale yellow flowers. Each has five pointed sepals with stalked black dots on the margins. The five petals also may have black dots and the many stamens are in bundles. Hairy St John's wort is very similar to common St John's wort (H. perforatum) but can be distinguished by the downy stems and the much longer leaves.",
    "Habitat": "Hypericum hirsutum grows in poor grassland on well-drained clay, limy and chalky soils. It is often found at the edges of woodland, on river banks and roadside verges. It is found throughout Western Europe, and in the United Kingdom it flowers from July to August.",
    "Phytochemistry": "Miquelianin (Quercetin 3-O-glucuronide), a type of phenolic compound, is present in H. hirsutum.\n\n\n== References =="
