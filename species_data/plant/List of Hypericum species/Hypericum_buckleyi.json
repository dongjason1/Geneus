    "__SUMMARY__": "Hypericum buckleyi, or Buckley's St. Johnswort and formerly known as Hypericum buckleii, is a species in the genus Hypericum. It is found in the Southeastern United States.",
    "Description": "Buckley's St. Johnswort is a small shrub, growing up to 45 cm (18 in) tall and spreading to form low, compact mats. It has peeling, reddish stems with thin bark. The oblong or oblanceolate leaves are sessile or subsessile, up to 25 mm (0.98 in) long and 12 mm (0.47 in) broad. Typically just one flower is produced per flowerhead, though it may have up to 5. The flowers are 20–25 mm (0.79–0.98 in) across with 5 golden yellow petals, becoming reflexed with age. The ovaries have three parts, forming narrowly ovoid to cylindric capsules.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Hypericum buckleyi has a limited range, known only to occur in the Appalachian Mountains, at 900–1,560 m (2,950–5,120 ft), in northeastern Georgia, northwestern South Carolina, and southwestern North Carolina. Its habitat includes wetlands such as seeps, moist crevices, and sometimes roadside ditches.\n\n\n== References =="
