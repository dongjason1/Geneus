    "__SUMMARY__": "Pandanus rigidifolius is a species of plant in the family Pandanaceae, endemic to Mauritius.",
    "Description": "A low, small, spreading, many-branched tree. It produces lots of stilt-like roots, along the trunk, but also along the length of the side-branches.\nIt can be distinguished by its compact (often trifarious) rosettes of small, rigid, erect, red-spined, deep blue-green leaves. These are usually only 75 cm long and 6 cm wide, folded length-wise (reduplicate), stiff, erect, and have an abrupt, obtuse leaf-tip. The reddish spines are closely set along the margins of the leaves.\nThe small (7–8 cm) fruit-head is held erect on a short peduncle, and enclosed in three-ranked (trifarious) bracts. Each fruit-head is packed with 200-220 small, unilocular drupes, with slightly convex tips.\nIn its appearance, it is most similar to the other dwarf Mauritian species Pandanus microcarpus, as well as the Madagascan species Pandanus microcephalus.",
    "Distribution": "It was endemic to Mauritius, where it was formerly common in the damp wetlands of the highlands near Le Petrin and Les Mares.\n\n\n== References =="
