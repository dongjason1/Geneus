    "Description": "Karagumoy typically grows to 4 to 8 m (13 to 26 ft) tall. It has a round trunk around 12 to 15 cm (4.7 to 5.9 in) in diameter that is either unbranched or have a few branches. Prop roots emerge from the trunk near the base. It has dark green elongated and very thick leaves, around 3 to 6 m (9.8 to 19.7 ft) long and 6 to 10 cm (2.4 to 3.9 in) wide, with small sharp spines at the edges. The leaves are spirally-arranged leaves at the end of branches.Karagumoy is dioecious with separate male and female plants. The fruits resemble jackfruit. They have an elongated capsule shape covered with small spines. They are typically 60 cm (24 in) or longer in length, and 20 cm (7.9 in) in width or wider.",
