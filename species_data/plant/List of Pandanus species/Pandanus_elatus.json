    "__SUMMARY__": "Pandanus elatus is a dioecious tropical plant in the screwpine genus.  It is endemic to Christmas Island, an Australian territory in the north-eastern Indian Ocean.  Its specific epithet comes from the Latin elatus (tall), in reference to its growth habit.",
    "Description": "Pandanus elatus is an erect tree, with basal prop roots, that grows to 20 m in height.  Its leaves grow to 3 m long and 100 mm wide, dark green and with marginal prickles.  The plants do not form the densely tangled thickets that characterise P. christmatensis.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Found only on Christmas Island, the tree is found on deeper soils in the rainforest, sometimes in small groves.",
    "Taxonomy": "The tree is closely related to P. leram Jones, of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the southern coasts of Sumatra and western Java.",
