    "__SUMMARY__": "Pandanus laxespicatus is a screwpine or pandan of the wetlands of Madagascar, and belonging to the monocot family  Pandanaceae. It was of fairly recent discovery, having been unknown to science prior to 1951 when described by Martelli and Pichi-Sermolli.  For the next seventeen years, it was just another member of a large family, but in 1968 Dr. Benjamin C. Stone discovered that at a certain stage of its growth it produces the longest linear (ribbon-like) leaves of any known plant; up to 33 feet (10 meters) in length while only fourteen inches (35 cm) in width.\n\n\n== References =="
