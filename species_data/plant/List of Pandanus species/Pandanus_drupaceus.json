    "__SUMMARY__": "Pandanus drupaceus is a species of plant in the family Pandanaceae, endemic to Mauritius.",
    "Description": "A low-lying, spreading, freely-branching tree. Decumbent branches can lie along the ground and root to form new trees. There are only a few stilt-roots at the base of the trunk, and the pale grey bark is cracked and fissured.\nIt can easily be distinguished from related species by its rosettes of wide, flat, stiff, incurved leaves. These have reddish-orange marginal spines only near the tip of the leaf, and not near the leaf base.\nThe large (20–25 cm) fruit-head is held erect on a short peduncle. Each fruit-head is packed with 20-30 purple, flattened, angular drupes.",
    "Distribution": "It was endemic to Mauritius, where it was formerly common in the highlands. It grows in wet areas and marshes, but also dryer rocky outcrops.\n\n\n== References =="
