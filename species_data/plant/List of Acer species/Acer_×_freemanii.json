    "__SUMMARY__": "Acer × freemanii, Freeman maple or Freeman's maple, is a naturally occurring hybrid maple that is the result of a cross between Acer rubrum (red maple) and Acer saccharinum (silver maple). The species is named for Oliver M. Freeman of the U.S. National Arboretum who hybridized A. rubrum with A. saccharinum in 1933. Wild specimens are found in eastern North America where the parent species overlap. The fall foliage is a striking orange-red. It has many commercially available cultivars and is frequently used as a street tree.",
    "Cultivars": "The cultivars are typically deliberately hybridized and selected in nurseries, not drawn from the wild specimens. Usually infertile (a desirable trait in cultivated maples), they have stronger branch attachments than silver maples and faster growth rates than red maples.\n'Armstrong', with a more yellow fall foliage\nAutumn Fantasy®\n'Celzam', trade name CELEBRATION\nFirefall™\n'Jeffersred', trade name AUTUMN BLAZE, recipient of the RHS's Award of Garden Merit\n'Marmo', which does not produce seeds\n'Morgan' trade name INDIAN SUMMER\n'Scarsen', trade name SCARLET SENTINEL\nSienna Glen®",
    "Description": "Even high-powered morphometric analyses of leaf shape cannot easily distinguish Acer × freemanii individuals from the parent species. All that can be said is that Acer × freemanii is generally intermediate between the parents. \n\n\n== References =="
