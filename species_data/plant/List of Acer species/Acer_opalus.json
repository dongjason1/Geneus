    "__SUMMARY__": "Acer opalus (Italian maple) is a species of maple native to the hills and mountains of southern and western Europe, from Italy to Spain and north to southern Germany, and also in northwest Africa in Morocco and Algeria.",
    "Description": "Acer opalus is a medium-sized deciduous tree growing to 20 metres (66 ft) tall, with a trunk up to 1 m diameter. The leaves are glossy green, 7–13 centimetres (2.8–5.1 in) long and 5–16 centimetres (2.0–6.3 in) across, palmately lobed with blunt teeth. They turn yellow in autumn.\nThe bark is grey and pinkish. It peels in square plates. It has small yellow flowers that open before the leaves appear. The fruit is a pair of winged samaras, each seed up to 1 centimetre (0.39 in) in diameter with a 1.5–2.5 centimetres (0.59–0.98 in) wing.",
    "Description-Subspecies": "Acer opalus trees with shallowly lobed leaves are sometimes separated as a distinct subspecies Acer opalus subsp. obtusatum. The characteristics are not always constant, so no subspecies are recognized by the Flora Europaea.",
