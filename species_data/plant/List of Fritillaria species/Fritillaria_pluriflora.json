It grows in the adobe clay soils of the Coast Ranges and low hills in the Central Valley from Tehama and Mendocino Counties south to Solano County. Calflora lists a collection from Sacramento County, but this is from a suburban area near the City of Sacramento and probably a cultivated specimen.",

It has up to ten  thick, long, oval-shaped leaves with wavy margins, most of which are clustered at ground level. The nodding flower has bright pink tepals each one to four centimeters long.
