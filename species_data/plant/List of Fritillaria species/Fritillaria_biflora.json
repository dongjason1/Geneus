    "__SUMMARY__": "Fritillaria biflora (chocolate lily, mission bells) is a species of fritillary native to western California and northern Baja California. It occurs in the chaparral and woodlands ecoregion, often in serpentine soil formations and hillside grassland habitats.Fritillaria biflora is a perennial herb up to 60 cm tall. It is called \"chocolate lily\" because its flowers can resemble the color of chocolate, although sometimes they are dark brown, greenish purple, or yellowish green. Flowers bloom in March and April.Fritillaria biflora should not be confused with Arthropodium strictum, which is also called \"chocolate lily\". In the latter, the scent is reminiscent of chocolate, rather than the color. The Kamchatka fritillary (F. camschatcensis) is sometimes also called \"chocolate lily\" in Alaska.",
