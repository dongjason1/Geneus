    "__SUMMARY__": "Fritillaria rhodocanakis  is a Greek species of plants in the lily family. In its pure form, it is found only on Hydra Island (also called Ydra or Hydrea or Ύδρα) and on small neighboring islands. Additional populations occur in the Peloponnisos region of mainland Greece, though the specimens there show some degree of hybridization with F. spetsiotica and F. graeca. In 1987, some of the hybrids were described with the name Fritillaria rhodocanakis subsp. argolica, but this is now generally referred to as Fritillaria × spetsiotica Kamari.Fritillaria rhodocanakis is a bulb-forming perennial herb. Flowers are nodding (hanging downwards), each tepal purple with a yellow tip.The species is listed as endangered by the IUCN.",
