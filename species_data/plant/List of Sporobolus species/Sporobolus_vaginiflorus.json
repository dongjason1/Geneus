They are sheathed by the leaf bases, which are sometimes swollen or inflated and may have lines or tufts of short hairs. The herbage is green to purple in color.\nThe inflorescence is a dense, narrow, spikelike panicle no more than about 5 cm (2 in) long. It may be partially or completely enclosed in the sheath of the uppermost leaf. The spikelets are purple, pinkish, yellowish, or grayish in color and may be shiny.",
