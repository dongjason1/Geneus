Flowering in early–mid spring, Texas ragwort is a tall annual, \ngrowing to from 20 centimeters (7.9 in) to 80 centimeters (31 in) tall and similar to S. quaylei.Stems and leaves:\nThe leaves with broadly winged leaf stalks, grow from single stems; the nodes between leaves getting shorter and shorter higher on the stem.  Ovate leaves with pointed tips 3 centimeters (1.2 in) to 10 centimeters (3.9 in) long by 1.5 centimeters (0.59 in) to 4 centimeters (1.6 in) wide with tapered bases.  Leaves at the lower portion of the plant have more teeth on their edges than the leaves at the upper portion of the mature plant.Stems and leaves are covered loosely and unevenly with a mat of fine hairs, occasionally having no hairs.Flowers:\nFlowering stalks have 10 to 30 flower heads which as a group make a flat top to the whole plant.  Each flower head is surrounded by 2 to 8 bractlets or mini-leaves, each 1 millimeter (0.039 in) to more than 2 millimeters (0.079 in).  Approximately 13 green to grayish bracts, 7 millimeters (0.28 in) to 10 millimeters (0.39 in) long surrounding 8 ray florets and an 8 millimeters (0.31 in) to 10 millimeters (0.39 in) corolla.Fruits:\nOne seeded fruits with rigid pappus.Roots:\nRoots relatively thin and branching.",
