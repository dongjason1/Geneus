Its use is widespread in many tropical and subtropical regions, but is especially prominent in tropical Africa.  Its fleshy, mucilaginous leaves and stems are eaten as a vegetable, and many parts of the plant have medical uses. However, the safety of internal use needs further research due to the presence of plant toxins.",
