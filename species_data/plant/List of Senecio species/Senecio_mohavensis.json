It is mostly hairless and green to purple in color.\nThe leaves have lobed or toothed blades a few centimeters long, the lower on short petioles and those higher on the plant with wide bases that clasp the stem.\nThe inflorescence is a spreading array of several flower heads filled with yellow disc florets, typically numbering between 15 and 30. Some heads have tiny ray florets that may be tucked out of view within the phyllaries. The phyllaries are typically green, hairless, mostly fused, and measure about a third of an inch.
