    "__SUMMARY__": "Packera plattensis, commonly known as prairie ragwort or prairie groundsel, is a species of the genus Packera and family Asteraceae.  It used to be placed in the genus Senecio.\nPrairie groundsel is found throughout the tallgrass prairie region. It blooms fairly early for a prairie wildflower: from April to July depending on the climate.It is easily confused with golden ragwort (Packera aurea) which has a hairless stem and heart-shaped basal leaves, and Senecio integerrimus, which has leaves that are mostly entire instead of fern-like, and much larger basal leaves.",
