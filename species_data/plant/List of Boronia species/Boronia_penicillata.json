    "__SUMMARY__": "Boronia penicillata is a plant in the citrus family, Rutaceae and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It is a low, spreading shrub with pinnate leaves and white flowers with four petals and eight stamens.",
    "Description": "Boronia penicillata is a spreading shrub that grows to a height of 30 cm (10 in). The leaves are sessile and pinnate with three or five leaflets, each leaflet linear to narrow wedge-shaped and 5–12 mm (0.2–0.5 in) long. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a pedicel 1–2 mm (0.04–0.08 in) long. The four sepals are egg-shaped, 1.5–2 mm (0.059–0.079 in) long and the four petals are white and 2–3.5 mm (0.079–0.14 in) long. The eight stamens are slightly hairy and there is a very short point on the end of the anthers. Flowering occurs mainly from October to November.",
    "Taxonomy and naming": "Boronia penicillata was first formally described in 1863 by George Bentham from a specimen collected by James Drummond and the description was published in Flora Australiensis. The specific epithet (penicillata) is derived from the Latin word penicillum meaning \"little tail\", \"painter's brush\" or \"tuft\"..",
    "Distribution and habitat": "This boronia grows in sand and has a disjunct distribution between Toodyay and the Fitzgerald River.",
