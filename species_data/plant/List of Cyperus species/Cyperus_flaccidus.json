It blooms between May and April producing green flowers.The leaves are 1 to 2 mm (0.039 to 0.079 in) wide, and are often reduced to sheaths and much shorter than the culms. The simple head-like inflorescences have between three and seven branches and are around 8 cm (3.1 in) in length. The digitate clusters to have a diameter of around 15 mm (0.59 in) with leaf-like bracts the lowest of which is erect and looks like a continuation of the culm and has alength exceeding that of the inflorescence. There are two to eight flattened spikelets cluster containing 20 flowers. After flowering a broad ovoid shaped brown nut will form that is 0.5 mm (0.020 in) in length with a diameter of about 0.3 mm (0.012 in).",
