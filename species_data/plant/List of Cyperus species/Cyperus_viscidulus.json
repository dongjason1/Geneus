    "__SUMMARY__": "Cyperus viscidulus is a sedge of the family Cyperaceae that is native to north western Australia.The rhizomatous perennial herb to grass-like sedge typically grows to a height of 0.3 to 1.15 metres (1.0 to 3.8 ft) and has a tufted habit. It blooms between February and August producing yellow-brown flowers.The species was first formally described by the botanist Karen Louise Wilson in 1980 as part of the work Notes on some Australian species of Cyperaceae as published in the journal Telopea. The only synonym is Cyperus sporobolus var. sexflorus but the species is often incorrecty identified as Cyperus carinatus or Cyperus sporobolus.In Western Australia it is found along streams and creeks and surrounding water holes in the Kimberley region where it grows in sandy alluvial soils often around sandstone. It is also found in western parts of the top end of the Northern Territory.",
