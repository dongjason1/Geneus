It is an aquatic species, growing as a marginal plant in up to about 15 cm of still or slow-moving water.",
    "Taxonomy": "Nobuyuki Tanaka, one of the leading researchers on genus Canna, recognises two varieties of Canna glauca: Canna glauca var. glauca and Canna glauca var. siamensis (Kraenzl) N.Tanaka. The latter variety widespread in South and Southeast Asia, where it is supposed to have differentiated within the past few centuries.",
