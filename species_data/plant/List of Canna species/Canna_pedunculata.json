    "__SUMMARY__": "Canna pedunculata is a species of the Canna genus, belonging to the family Cannaceae. Native of south-east Brazil at low altitudes. Johnson's Dictionary of 1856 reports that it first entered England in 1820, pedunculata meaning 'long-flower-stalked'.\nIt is a perennial growing to 2.5 m (8 ft) tall. It is hardy to zone 10 and is frost tender. In the north latitudes it is in flower from August to October, and the seeds ripen in October. The flowers are hermaphrodite.",
    "Synonyms": "Canna buekii Weinm.\nCanna reflexa Nees ex D.Dietr.",
    "Taxonomy": "In the last three decades of the 20th century, Canna species have been categorised by two different taxonomists, Paulus Johannes Maria Maas from the Netherlands and Nobuyuki Tanaka from Japan. The two taxonomists are in agreement that this is a separate and distinct species.",
