    "__SUMMARY__": "Caladenia sp. Kilsyth South, known as Kilsyth South spider orchid, is an extremely rare ground orchid endemic to Kilsyth South, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.  The flower was discovered in 1991 and described by the local ecologist Dr. Graeme Lorimer. \nThe plant is described as \"a terrestrial orchid growing to 35 cm tall, with one to two large creamy white flowers\". The tepals grow to 70 mm long, giving it its spider-like appearance, and have reddish-brown glandular tips. The labellum (lip) of the flower has reddish calli and teeth. Only 23 plants were ever observed,  while currently the population decreased to only one adult flowering plant. The Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne attempts to undertake a propagation trial of the orchid’s seeds.",
