A single yellowish-green and red flower is borne on a spike 80–250 mm (3–10 in) tall. The sepals and petals have thick, brownish, club-like glandular tips 6–25 mm (0.2–1 in) long. The dorsal sepal is erect, 40–55 mm (1.6–2.2 in) long and 2–3 mm (0.08–0.1 in) wide. The lateral sepals are 40–55 mm (1.6–2.2 in) long, 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) wide and are parallel to each other and held below horizontal. The petals are 30–40 mm (1–2 in) long, about 2 mm (0.08 in) wide and also turned slightly downwards. The labellum is 17–20 mm (0.7–0.8 in) long and 18–20 mm (0.7–0.8 in) wide and greenish-white with a dark red tip. The sides of the labellum turn upwards and have between four and six teeth up to 6 mm (0.2 in) long. The tip of the labellum curls downwards and there are four rows of crowded calli up to 3 mm (0.1 in) long, along its mid-line. Flowering occurs from September to October.",
