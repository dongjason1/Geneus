    "__SUMMARY__": "Potentilla gracilis, known as slender cinquefoil  or graceful cinquefoil, is a species of cinquefoil.\nNamed varieties are:\n\nPotentilla gracilis var. elmeri (Rydb.) Jeps. – combleaf cinquefoil\nPotentilla gracilis var. flabelliformis (Lehm.) Nutt.This perennial herb is variable in morphology, growing erect stems up to a meter tall from a branching caudex and rhizome unit. The leaves are palmate and compound, each divided into five to seven wide lance-shaped leaflets with toothed edges. The leaflets are hairy, with many more hairs on the undersides, making them lighter in color than the top surfaces. The basal leaves are borne on very long petioles. Leaves higher on the stem are smaller and reduced. The inflorescence is a cyme of several flowers, each with usually five yellow petals.\nIt is a larval host to the two-banded checkered skipper.",
