    "__SUMMARY__": "Scaevola hookeri, the creeping fan-flower or alpine fan-flower,  is a prostrate perennial herb in the family Goodeniaceae. It is native to eastern Australia. Leaves are 6 to 50 mm long and 2 to 15 mm wide.  Flowers are white or blue with a yellowish throat and appear between December and March in the species' native range. The species was first formally described by W.H. de Vriese in 1850 in Nederlandsch Kruidkundig Archief and given the name Merkusia hookeri. The species was transferred to the genus Scaevola in 1856. It occurs in grassland and woodland in high altitude areas in Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania, and also South Australia where it is listed as \"endangered\".\n\n\n== References =="
