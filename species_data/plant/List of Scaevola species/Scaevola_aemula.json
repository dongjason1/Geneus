    "__SUMMARY__": "Scaevola aemula, the fairy fan-flower or common fan-flower, is a small shrub in the family Goodeniaceae, native to southern Australia.  It grows to 50 cm in height and produces white or blue  flowers in spikes up to 24 cm long from August to March in its native range.  These are followed by rounded, wrinkled berries to 4.5 mm in length.The species occurs in Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales.The species is thought to be the most commonly cultivated of the  genus Scaevola, and a large number of cultivars have been developed. \nMost of these are mat-forming to a height of 12 cm and spreading up to 1 metre in width. It prefers a sunny or partially shaded, well-drained position and tolerates salt spray and periods of drought. Pruning and pinching of tip growth may be carried out to shape the plant. Propagation is from cuttings or by layering.\n\n\n== References =="
