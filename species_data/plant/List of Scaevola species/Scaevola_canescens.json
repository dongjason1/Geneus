    "Description": "Scaevola canescens (grey scaevola) is a shrub growing up to 60 centimetres (24 in) high. It has sessile, entire, oblong to oblanceolate leaves which are 12–85 millimetres (0.47–3.35 in) long and 4–15 millimetres (0.16–0.59 in) wide and densely hairy. It flowers from March to October in axillary spikes up to 10 centimetres (3.9 in) long, the corolla is bearded, and white with brownish veins. The fruit is usually one-seeded.",

A term applied to hairy surfaces” (Lindley); “hoary with gray pubescence” (Fernald 1950); becoming gray, grayish; in mosses, hoary due to the collective hyaline hair points on the apices of leaves.",
    "Taxonomy": "S. canescens was first described by George Bentham in 1837. A holotype (W0047196) was collected by von Hügel at King Georges Sound, and is kept at Naturhistorisches Museum Wien Botanische Abteilung (W).  The earliest Australian record (MEL 1521288A) was collected by J.A.L. Preiss on April 15, 1839, somewhere in the vicinity of Perth.\n\n\n== References =="
