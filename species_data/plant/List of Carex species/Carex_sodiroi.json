    "__SUMMARY__": "Carex sodiroi is a species of sedge known from a single collection made by Luis Sodiro at some time before 1886. It was found around 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) from Nanegalito, and described as a new species by the sedge expert Georg Kükenthal in 1904. The holotype was deposited in the Berlin herbarium, where it may have been destroyed in the Second World War; if there are no isotypes in Ecuador, then the only record of the species may be a photograph in the Field Museum in Chicago.",
