    "__SUMMARY__": "Carex adusta, commonly known as the lesser brown sedge or the browned sedge, is a species of sedge (Carex) in the section Ovales. First described scientifically in 1839 by Francis Boott, it is found in Canada and the northeastern United States, where it grows in dry, acidic, sandy soils.  Adusta is Latin for \"burnt,\" probably referring to the color.",
    "Description": "The plants have densely clustered culms that grow 2.5–8 cm (1.0–3.1 in) high, and leaves measuring 7–25 cm (2.8–9.8 in) long by 2–3.5 mm wide.\n\n\n== References =="
