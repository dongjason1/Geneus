    "__SUMMARY__": "Carex interior is a species of sedge known by the common name inland sedge. It is native to much of North America from Alaska to northern Mexico to the mid-Atlantic United States. It grows in wet habitat, most often in calcareous soils. This sedge produces clumps of stems approaching a meter in maximum height, with a few leaves at each stem. The inflorescence is an open array of star-shaped spikes of flowers covered with gold scales. The fruit is coated in a toothed, red-tipped perigynium.",
