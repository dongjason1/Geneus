    "Description": "This sedge, Carex hassei, is similar to the Golden sedge, Carex aurea, and has sometimes been treated as part of that species. It produces stems up to about 40 centimeters tall, or sometimes taller. The inflorescence has a long, leaflike bract that is longer than the spikes. The flowers have reddish-brown, white-tipped scales and the fruit is coated in a perigynium which is fleshy, bumpy, and light in color.",
