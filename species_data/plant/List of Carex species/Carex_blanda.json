    "__SUMMARY__": "Carex blanda, the common woodland sedge or eastern woodland sedge, is a sedge native to a wide variety of habitats in the eastern and central United States and Canada.Its leaves are 1–10 mm (0.039–0.394 inches) wide and 14–36 mm (9⁄16–1 7⁄16 inches) long. The stem usually has a staminate (male) spike at the tip, two pistillate (female) spikes closely clustered near it, as well as another pistillate spike lower down. The pistillate spikes have 4 to 36 perigynia each, which develop into seeds (achenes).Carex blanda is rather common in its native range, and tends to spread aggressively, particularly in disturbed soils.\n\n\n== References =="
