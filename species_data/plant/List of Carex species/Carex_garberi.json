    "__SUMMARY__": "Carex garberi is a species of sedge known by the common names elk sedge and Garber's sedge. It is native to northern North America, where it occurs throughout Canada and Alaska and down through the higher elevations as far south as the San Francisco Bay Area of California.This sedge produces loose clumps of stems up to 40 to 70 centimeters tall. The leaves may be shorter or much taller than the stems, but are only a few millimeters wide. There are inflorescences at the tips and along the sides of the stem; the lateral ones are pistillate, while the terminal ones usually have both male and female flowers. The scales covering the flowers are brown with a pale stripe through the midline.This sedge grows in many types of forests and meadows, usually in wet places such as swamps or pools. It is common around the Great Lakes.",
