    "__SUMMARY__": "Carex barbarae is a species of sedge known as Santa Barbara sedge.",
    "Description": "This sedge produces angled, hairless stems up to one meter tall or slightly taller, but not in clumps. The tough leaves are narrow with shredding, red-spotted or purple basal sheaths. The inflorescence produces erect and drooping spikes up to about 8 centimeters long with an associated long bract which exceeds the length of the spikes. The fruits are covered in a sac called a perigynium which is light to dark brown and sometimes red-spotted, leathery and tough, and sometimes with a toothed, hairy tip. The plant rarely matures into a fruiting stage, however, with most individuals remaining sterile.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Santa Barbara sedge is native to the western United  States, in California and Oregon. It grows in wet and seasonally wet habitat, such as meadows and riverbanks.",
    "Uses": "Parts of this sedge were used in basketry and as sewing fiber by California Native American groups such as the Maidu and Pomo.",
