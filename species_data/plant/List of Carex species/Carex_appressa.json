    "__SUMMARY__": "Carex appressa, commonly known as the tall sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as sedges.",
    "Description": "Carex appressa is a densely tufted, perennial sedge that forms clumps up to 50 cm (20 in) in diameter. Its stems grow to around 100 cm (39 in) in height, and are hard and solid, becoming rough towards the top of the stem. Its leaves are 3–6 mm (0.12–0.24 in) wide, are rough on the margins, and grow mostly out of the base of the plant. It has a brownish, spike-like inflorescence made of 20 or more spikes, growing 5–25 cm (2.0–9.8 in) long. Its flowers are numerous oval-shaped brownish spikelets that are approximately 5 mm (0.20 in) long, with both male and female flowers mixed together in the spikes. Its nut is contained in a flattened, oval-shaped, beaked, hairless sack or utricle that is 3–3.5 mm (0.12–0.14 in) long.",
    "Habitat and Ecology": "Carex appressa occurs in swamps, watercourses, and occasionally in water. It is native to Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, and generally in the South West Pacific. It also serves as a larval food plant for Heteronympha cordace.",
