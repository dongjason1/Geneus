    "__SUMMARY__": "Carex magellanica, or the boreal bog sedge, is a Carex species that is native to North America. It is listed as endangered in Connecticut.",
    "Description": "Carex magellanica grows loosely tufted from a short to long rhizome. Its culms grow upward of 55 cm (22 in), and are leafy in their lower part. These leaves are shorter than the culms, and 2–4 mm (0.079–0.157 in) wide, distinguishing the plant from the similar Carex limosa, or \"muck sedge\", which has leaves greater than 4 mm (0.16 in) in width. Its terminal spikelet is contains only the stamen, with one to four other spikelets that are ovoid and pistillate, arranged on drooping, slender peduncles.\n\n\n== References =="
