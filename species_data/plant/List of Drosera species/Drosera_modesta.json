    "__SUMMARY__": "Drosera modesta, the modest rainbow, is a scrambling perennial tuberous species in the carnivorous plant genus Drosera. It is endemic to Western Australia and grows on granite outcrops or stream banks in laterite or sand-clay soils. D. modesta produces shield-shaped carnivorous leaves with longer than normal tentacles. The scrambling stems can be 0.3–0.8 m (1.0–2.6 ft) long. White flowers bloom from October to November.Drosera modesta was first described and named by Ludwig Diels in 1904.",
