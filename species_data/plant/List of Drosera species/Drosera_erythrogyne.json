It grows in soils that are peat-sand to loam and occurs in an area along the southern Western Australian coast west of Albany in swamps or near granite outcrops. It produces small leaves along a long, scrambling stem that can grow to 2–3 m (7–10 ft) long. White flowers emerge from August to October.D. erythrogyne was first described and named by N. G. Marchant and Allen Lowrie in 1992.",
