    "__SUMMARY__": "Drosera humilis is a perennial tuberous species in the genus Drosera that is endemic to Western Australia. It has 3 to 5 semi-erect stems that are 3 to 15 cm long with carnivorous leaves arranged in whorls around the stems. It is native to a region from the Moore River north to Kalbarri and east to Ajana and Wongan Hills. It grows in winter-wet sandy soils in heathland. It flowers from June to September.It was first formally described by Jules Émile Planchon in 1848. Twice the taxon was reorganized and assigned to a taxonomic rank under D. stolonifera, once in 1906 by Ludwig Diels and again in 1982 by Neville Graeme Marchant.",
