    "__SUMMARY__": "Drosera pygmaea is a carnivorous, rosette-forming biennial or annual herb native to Australia and New Zealand. The specific epithet, which translates as \"dwarf\" from Latin, is a reference to the very small size of this plant, which grows to between 8 and 18 mm in diameter. Small, pale flowers are produced at the ends of 1- to 3-inch stems. It is perhaps the most well-known of the pygmy sundews.\n\n\n== References =="
