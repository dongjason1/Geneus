    "__SUMMARY__": "Drosera filiformis, commonly known as the thread-leaved sundew, is a small, insectivorous, rosette-forming species of perennial herb. A species of sundew, it is unusual within its genus in that the long, erect, filiform (thread-like) leaves of this plant unroll in spirals – an arrangement similar to the circinate vernation seen in ferns.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "D. filiformis occurs naturally in both Canada and the United States; its natural range extends down the eastern seaboard of North America from south western Nova Scotia in the north down through New England to Florida in the south.",
    "Cultivation": "D. filiformis is frequently cultivated, with a few registered cultivars, such as D. filiformis var. filiformis (also known as D. filiformis typical),  D. filiformis × 'California Sunset' (a hybrid between D. filiformis var. filiformis and D.tracyi),. All of these cultivars are grown with similar conditions as most other Drosera species: mineral-poor soil and distilled, reverse osmosis, or collected rain water. D. filiformis  require a winter dormancy for long-term survival, forming hibernacula in the winter.",
    "Infraspecific taxa": "Drosera filiformis f. tracyi (Macf. ex Diels) Macf. (1914)\nDrosera filiformis var. tracyi (Macf. ex Diels) Diels (1906)\nDrosera filiformis var. typica Winne (1944) nom.illeg.\n\n\n== References =="
