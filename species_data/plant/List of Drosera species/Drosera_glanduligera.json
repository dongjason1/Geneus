    "__SUMMARY__": "Drosera glanduligera, the pimpernel sundew, is a rosetted annual species in the carnivorous plant genus Drosera that is endemic to Australia. It is 2.5–6 cm (1–2 in) tall and grows in most soil conditions. It produces orange flowers from August to November. It was originally described in 1844 by Johann Georg Christian Lehmann. It is the sole species in the subgenus Coelophylla, which Jan Schlauer elevated from section rank in 1996; it was originally described by Jules Émile Planchon in 1848.",
    "Distribution": "Drosera glanduligera is native to Tasmania and south western and south eastern Australia where it is often locally abundant.",
    "Biology": "Drosera glanduligera is an annual plant that grows in the winter. Germination of the seeds requires cold temperatures. Young plants eat springtails while larger plants eat flies.The trapping mechanism of this species is unique in that it combines features of both flypaper and snap traps; it has been termed a catapult-flypaper trap. Non-flying insects trigger this catapult when certain plant cells break. Then this process cannot be repeated until the plant grows new tentacles.",
