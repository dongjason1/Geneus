    "__SUMMARY__": "Symphyotrichum dumosum, common names rice button aster or bushy aster, is an herbaceous plant in the aster family. It is native to a widespread area across the eastern half of the United States from Texas to Florida to Maine to Wisconsin. It is also native to New Brunswick and Ontario, and is cultivated in other places.Symphyotrichum dumosum is a perennial herb up to 100 cm (40 in) tall. Heads are born in paniculiform arrays. Ray flowers are blue, pink, purple or white; disc flowers pale yellow, turning pink with age.This species was long known as Aster dumosus before it was moved into its current genus due to a phylogenetic analysis. The genus Aster has been narrowed considerably in scope in recent years, due to new information about the relationships of the species in the group.",
