    "__SUMMARY__": "Symphyotrichum oolentangiense or Aster azureus (common name skyblue aster or azure aster) is a species of flowering plant in the daisy family Asteraceae, native to North American Atlantic Region.",
    "History": "Botanist John Leonard Riddell originally described this flower in 1835 and named it Aster oolentangiensis after the Olentangy River, where he found it near Worthington, Ohio. Riddell originally misspelled the name of the river with two Os. Its name was later changed to Aster azureus. When the genus was changed to Symphyotrichum the older species name had precedence.\nThe plant is endangered in New York.",
