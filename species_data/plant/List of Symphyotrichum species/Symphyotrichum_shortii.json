    "__SUMMARY__": "Symphyotrichum shortii, commonly called Short's aster, is a species of flowering plant in the aster family (Asteraceae). It is native to North America, where it is primarily found in interior areas, east of the Mississippi River. Its natural habitat is in thin, rocky soils of woodlands and thickets, often around limestone bluffs. It is common throughout much of its range, although it is generally restricted to intact natural communities.Symphyotrichum shortii is an herbaceous perennial, growing up to 3½ feet. It produces heads of flowers with purple rays in late summer and fall. Unlike many related Symphyotrichum, its stem leaves are essentially entire, and do not have a winged petiole. It bears a resemblance to the related Symphyotrichum oolentangiense of farther west, from which S. shortii can be distinguished by its cordate stem leaves and glabrous phyllaries.The taxonomy of Symphyotrichum remains poorly understood, with the relationships between the taxa unclear.\n\n\n== References =="
