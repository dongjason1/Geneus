    "__SUMMARY__": "Symphyotrichum pilosum, commonly called the hairy white oldfield aster or frost aster, is an herbaceous plant in the aster family.\nIt is native to eastern North America, where it is found in Canada and the United States.  It is widespread and common throughout its range. Its natural habitat includes communities such as prairies, open woodlands, and outcrops. In general, it responds positively to disturbance, and is often seen occupying sunny, weedy habitats.Two varieties are recognized, although determining the best taxonomy for this group is difficult due to polyploidy and hybridization. The two currently recognized varieties are:\nS. pilosum var. pilosum — stems and leaves hairy, widespread and often weedy\nS. pilosum var. pringlei — stems and leaves mostly smooth, found on alvars, cedar glades, and sand dunes‘Ochtendgloren’, a cultivar of S. pilosum var. pringlei, has gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit.",
