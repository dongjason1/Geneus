    "__SUMMARY__": "Symphyotrichum depauperatum, also known as the serpentine aster, is a rare species of aster adapted to serpentine barrens, an ecosystem with a high concentration of toxic metals in the soil.Symphyotrichum depauperatum is a perennial herb up to 50 cm (20 inches) tall, with 1-3 stems. Leaves are narrow, generally 2–4 cm (0.8-1.6 inches) long. The plant produces numerous flower heads in branched arrays, each head with 7–14 white or pink ray flowers surrounding 7–17 yellow disc flowers.",
    "Distribution": "Symphyotrichum depauperatum grows in 20 of the 26 serpentine barrens in the east-central United States (Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina), and has been called a \"flagship\" species of this unique ecosystem.  It was previously thought to be endemic to these barrens, but it was recently confirmed to also occur in a disjoint population on diabase glades in North Carolina.",
    "Conservation": "Symphyotrichum depauperatum is classified by the state of Pennsylvania as a threatened species because its range is restricted to a few limited areas, and the majority of its populations occur on sites threatened by quarrying, housing and industrial development.\n\n\n== References =="
