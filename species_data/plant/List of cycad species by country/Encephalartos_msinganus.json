    "__SUMMARY__": "Encephalartos msinganus is a species of cycad from Kwazulu-Natal.",
    "Description": "It is an arborescent plant, with a stem up to 3 m tall and with a diameter of 35 cm.\nThe leaves are 110-150 cm long, light green in color, stiff and rather keeled. The spine is green, straight or slightly curved. The non-overlapping lanceolate leaflets, 14–17 cm long, are arranged on the rachis in the opposite way, with an insertion angle of about 60º; the margins are full and smooth and the apex thins to become a robust spine. The leaves of the basal part are smaller and are often reduced to spines.\nIt is a dioecious species, with ovoid-shaped male cones, pale yellow, 30–40 cm long and 11–12 cm broad. On each plant they grow up to four at a time. The female cones, about the same shape, are 42 cm long, have a diameter of 22 cm, and can be covered with a thin brown hair. Usually each plant produces one or two.\nThe seeds have an oblong shape and are covered by a red sarcotesta.",
