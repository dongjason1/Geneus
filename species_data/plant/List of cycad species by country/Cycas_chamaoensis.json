    "Habitat": "This cycad is native to eastern central Thailand, on Mount Khao Chamao northeast of Klaeng and southeast of Bangkok. This cycad grows from bare granite outcroppings, in full sun. It is closely related to Cycas pectinata. The conservation status is insecure, as local inhabitants treasure the plant for gardening purposes and the plant's range is restricted to only 1 mountain.",
