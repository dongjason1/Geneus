    "__SUMMARY__": "Salvia rubescens is a herbaceous perennial native to the state of Mérida in Venezuela. The University of California Botanical Garden had been growing it since 1993 from a plant collected that year in Venezuela, only identifying it as S. rubescens in 2001.Salvia rubescens is an erect plant that grows 4–5 feet tall, and is fully covered with mid-green ovate leaves with a sawtooth edge. The leaves grow as large as 4.5 inches long by 3.5 inches wide, and are lightly covered with hairs on both surfaces. The inflorescences grow another 1–2 feet above the foliage, with flowering beginning in midsummer and lasting until frost. The flower stems and the calyx are both dark purple and covered with fine hairs. The 1 inch flowers are a vibrant red-orange color, growing in widely spaced whorls. Many flowers come into bloom at the same time, making for a very showy plant.\n\n\n== Notes =="
