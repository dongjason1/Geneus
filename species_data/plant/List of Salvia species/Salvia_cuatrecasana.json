    "__SUMMARY__": "Salvia cuatrecasana is a perennial shrub that is endemic to a few small areas in Colombia, growing at 2,800 to 3,500 m (9,200 to 11,500 ft) elevation on roadsides, streamsides, and disturbed\nareas.\nS. cuatrecasana grows to 1 to 1.5 m (3.3 to 4.9 ft) high, with narrow ovate or elliptic leaves that are 3 to 6 cm (1.2 to 2.4 in) long and 1 to 3 cm (0.39 to 1.18 in) wide. The upper leaf is green with sparse hairs and distinctive veins. The inflorescence has short, dense, terminal racemes with a 15 mm (0.59 in) purple corolla held in a dark purple and strongly veined calyx. The dense, short racemes, purple flowers, and the prominent veins on leaf and calyx make the plant easily recognizable.\n\n\n== Notes =="
