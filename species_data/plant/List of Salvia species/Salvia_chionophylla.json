    "__SUMMARY__": "Salvia chionophylla is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to a small area in the state of Coahuila, Mexico. First described in 1907 by Merritt Lyndon Fernald, it was only seen in horticulture beginning around 1996. It is a trailing plant that spreads by rooting at its nodes, producing more trailing stems, with small rounded dove-gray leaves about 0.5 in long, evenly spaced along the stem. The small blue flowers are less than .25 in long on short inflorescences with whorls of 2–6 flowers.\n\n\n== Notes =="
