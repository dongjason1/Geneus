    "__SUMMARY__": "Salvia venulosa is a perennial plant that is native to a very small region of the Western Cordillera in Colombia. It grows at 1,500 to 2,000 m (4,900 to 6,600 ft) elevation in deeply shaded wooded gullies. S. venulosa grows less than 1 metre (3.3 ft) tall, with narrow ovate leaves that are 6 to 9 cm (2.4 to 3.5 in) long and 3 centimetres (1.2 in) wide, and violet on the underside. The flower is an unusual wine-red color.A 2010 phylogenetic study of Salvia divinorum and 52 other Salvia species in the subgenus Calosphace suggest that S. venulosa is the closest known relative of S. divinorum.\n\n\n== Notes =="
