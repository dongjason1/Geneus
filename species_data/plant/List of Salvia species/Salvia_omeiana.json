It is a robust erect-growing plant reaching .4 to 1 m (1.3 to 3.3 ft), with broad cordate-ovate to hastate-ovate leaves that are 10 to 16 cm (3.9 to 6.3 in) long and  6.5 to 14.5 cm (2.6 to 5.7 in) wide. Inflorescences are raceme-panicles, with a 2.5 to 3.5 cm (0.98 to 1.38 in) yellow corolla.\nThere are two varieties: Salvia omeiana var. omeiana has an ovate shaped bract, and no hairs inside the corolla tube. Salvia omeiana var. grandibracteata has a more lanceolate bract, and is slightly hairy inside the corolla tube.\n\n\n== References =="
