    "__SUMMARY__": "Salvia falcata is a perennial shrub that is endemic to a very small area in NW Cundinamarca in Colombia, growing in dry bushland in a steep river valley at around 1,000 m (3,300 ft) elevation—unusually low for red-flowered salvias.\nSalvia falcata grows to  2 m (6.6 ft) tall, with 4-angle stems, and with many branches. The leaves are lanceolate-elliptic to ovate-ellipitic, ranging from  6 to 11 cm (2.4 to 4.3 in) long and 1.8 to 4.7 cm (0.71 to 1.85 in) wide. The inflorescence has single racemes in the leaf axils with a 2.6 to 2.8 cm (1.0 to 1.1 in) red corolla.\n\n\n== Notes =="
