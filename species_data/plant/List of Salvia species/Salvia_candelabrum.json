    "__SUMMARY__": "Salvia candelabrum is a species of flowering plant in the family Lamiaceae, native to Spain. It is a woody-based  perennial growing to 100 cm (39 in), with woolly grey-green leaves that resemble those of the common sage, S. officinalis, and emit a similar scent when crushed. In summer it bears violet-blue flowers on branching stems held high above the foliage.Diterpenes have been isolated from its green tissues. From the aerial parts of Salvia candelabrum have been isolated β-sitosterol, nepeticin (lup-20(29)-ene-3j,lla-diol), candelabrone (11,12,14-trihydroxy-8,11,13-abietatriene-3,7-dione), the rearranged abietane diterpenoids candesalvone A (11,12,14-trihydroxy-19(4→3)-abeo-3,8,11,13-abietatetraen-7-one) and candesalvone B (11,12,14-trihydroxy-7-oxo-3,4-seco-4(18),8,11,13-abietatetraen-3-oic acid), and large amounts of ursolic and oleanolic acids. The root bark afforded 7α-acetoxyroyleanone, 12-O-methypisiferic acid and sugol.\n\nThis plant has ornamental value in the garden, and has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\n\n== References =="
