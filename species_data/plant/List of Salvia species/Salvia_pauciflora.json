    "__SUMMARY__": "Salvia pauciflora is a perennial plant that is native to Yunnan province in China, growing in and around forests at 2,800 to 3,400 m (9,200 to 11,200 ft) elevation. It grows on 2–4 slender unbranched stems with widely spaced leaves. The leaves are broadly ovate to ovate-triangular, typically ranging in size from 2.5 to 6 cm (0.98 to 2.36 in) long and  1.2 to 5 cm (0.47 to 1.97 in) wide.\nInflorescences are of racemes or panicles that are 2 to 8 cm (0.79 to 3.15 in), with a corolla that is purplish red or purple-white (rarely purplish), with white spotting on the lower lip. The corolla is 1.3 to 2 cm (0.51 to 0.79 in), rarely a bit longer.\nThe specific epithet pauciflora is Latin for 'few-flowered'.\n\n\n== References =="
