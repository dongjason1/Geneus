    "__SUMMARY__": "Salvia miniata (Belize sage) is a herbaceous perennial shrub from Belize and the Mexican state of Chiapas. It typically grows on shaded mountain hillsides at 600 m elevation. The single flowers are clear red, with an orange undertone, about 2.5 cm long. The flowers grow in whorls on inflorescences up to 30 cm long. Salvia miniata reaches about 1 m in height and width during the summer growing season, with many branches from the base, and myrtle-green glossy leaves measuring about 13 cm long and 5 cm wide.\n\n\n== Notes =="
