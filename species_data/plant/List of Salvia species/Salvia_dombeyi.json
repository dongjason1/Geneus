    "__SUMMARY__": "Salvia dombeyi  is a tender perennial found at approximately 3000 m elevation in Peru, and is popular with gardeners in Bolivia and Peru. In cultivation, and with proper support, this vining sage can climb from 3–6 m. The heart-shaped dark green leaves have a long petiole with short hairs. The flowers are among the largest salvia flowers, typically at least 8 cm long—with a 4 cm currant-red calyx and a 9 cm scarlet corolla.\n\n\n== Notes =="
