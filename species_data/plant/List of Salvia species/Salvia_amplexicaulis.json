    "__SUMMARY__": "Salvia amplexicaulis is a herbaceous perennial that is native to southeastern Europe. It is a close relative of Salvia nemorosa. Its specific epithet, amplexicaulis, refers to the \"stem-clasping\" stem leaves which have no stalks. Violet-blue flowers grow closely together in whorls, forming a nearly continuous spike, with plants reaching up to 90 cm (3.0 ft) tall.\n\n\n== Notes =="
