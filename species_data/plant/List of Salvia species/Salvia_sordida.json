    "__SUMMARY__": "Salvia sordida is a rare perennial shrub endemic to a very small area in Colombia, along an old road from Bogota to La Caro, growing at 2,600 m (8,500 ft) elevation in scrub next to streams.\nThe plant reaches up to 2 m (6.6 ft) tall, with the entire plant whitish-green in color. The ovate leaves are small—4 to 6 cm (1.6 to 2.4 in) long and 2 to 3.5 cm (0.79 to 1.38 in) wide—and grey tomentose underneath. The inflorescence has short, dense, terminal racemes, with a 16 mm (0.63 in) purple corolla. Flowers also grow in the axils of the upper leaves. It is the most threatened of all Colombia species in the family Labiatae.\n\n\n== Notes =="
