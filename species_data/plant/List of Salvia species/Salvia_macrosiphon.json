    "__SUMMARY__": "Salvia macrosiphon is a species of flowering plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is native to Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Transcaucasia, and Turkey, where it grows at the edges of fields. It is a perennial herb with a white corolla and ovate nutlets. It flowers in May and fruits from June onwards. Although the plant is similar to S. spinosa, it differs in that it has narrower leaves and calyces, is less indurate and has less spiny fruiting calyces, and possesses a longer corolla tube.\n\n\n== References =="
