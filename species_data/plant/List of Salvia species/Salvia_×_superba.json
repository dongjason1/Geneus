    "__SUMMARY__": "Salvia × superba is a widely grown Salvia hybrid. Its origins are unknown, though it first appeared in cultivation, and its parents are  believed to include Salvia × sylvestris and Salvia amplexicaulis. Salvia nemorosa has also been suggested as a direct parent or close relative, but with so many similarities between these species and hybrids, there is no conclusive evidence. It is often mistakenly called Salvia superba.Salvia × superba grows about 1 m (3.3 ft) tall, with flowers ranging from violet-blue to pale pink. The flowers grow in whorls that are a bit more separated than in their parents. Selected cultivars  include the confusingly named 'Superba', and 'Rubin'. The cultivar 'Rubin' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\n\n== References =="
