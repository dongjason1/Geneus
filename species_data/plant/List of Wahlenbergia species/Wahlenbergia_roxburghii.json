    "__SUMMARY__": "Wahlenbergia roxburghii, the Roxburgh bellflower or dwarf cabbage tree, is an extinct member of a group of four species of Wahlenbergia once known from the island of Saint Helena, in the South Atlantic Ocean. It was last seen by naturalist John Charles Melliss in 1872.\nIt is an example of one of the early extinctions of Saint Helena plants as a result of human activity, with a history similar to that of the stringwood (Acalypha rubrinervis), (see List of extinct plants).",
