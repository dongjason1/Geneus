    "__SUMMARY__": "Banksia drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's dryandra, is a shrub endemic to Western Australia. Depending on the subspecies, flowering occurs either mid-year, or at year's end.",
    "Description": "Drummond's dryandra has a prostrate to mounding habit, with the varying subspecies reaching between 1 and 1.5 metres in height and about the same width. The flowers grade from red to yellow and are typically buried deep within the plant.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "The various subspecies occur in differing parts of the wheatbelt in Western Australia, approximately from northeast of Perth through to around Bremer Bay.\nAn assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that its range is likely to contract by between 50% and 80% by 2080, depending on the severity of the change.",
    "Taxonomy": "There are three described subspecies:\n\nB. drummondii (Meisn.) A.R.Mast & K.R.Thiele subsp. drummondii\nB. drummondii subsp. hiemalis (A.S.George) A.R.Mast & K.R.Thiele\nB. drummondii subsp. macrorufa (A.S.George) A.R.Mast & K.R.Thiele\n\n\n== References =="
