The specific epithet is from the Latin tri- (\"three\") and fontinalis (\"of a spring\"), in reference to the town of Three Springs.In 2007, all Dryandra species were transferred to Banksia by Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele. Hence the current full name of the species is Banksia trifontinalis (A.S.George) A.R.Mast & K.R.Thiele.",
