    "__SUMMARY__": "Banksia tortifolia is a shrub endemic to Western Australia. It was first published as Dryandra tortifolia in 1855. In 1870, George Bentham demoted it to a variety of Dryandra arctotidis (now Banksia arctotidis), but this was overturned by Alex George in 1999. The name then remained D. tortifolia until 2007, when all Dryandra species were transferred to Banksia by Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele.",
