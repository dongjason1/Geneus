    "__SUMMARY__": "Banksia pellaeifolia is a shrub endemic to Western Australia.\nIt was known as Dryandra blechnifolia until 2007, when all Dryandra species were transferred to Banksia by Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele. As there was already a plant named Banksia blechnifolia, Mast and Thiele had to choose a new specific epithet; their choice, \"pellaeifolia\", is from Pellaea, a genus of ferns with pinnate leaves, and the Latin folium (\"leaf\"), in reference to the species' fern-like leaves.\nAn assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that its range is likely to contract by between 50% and 80% by 2080, depending on the severity of the change.",
