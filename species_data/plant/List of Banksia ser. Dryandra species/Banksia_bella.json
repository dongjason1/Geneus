    "__SUMMARY__": "Banksia bella, commonly known as the Silver Wongan Dryandra or Wongan Dryandra, is a shrub endemic to Western Australia. Unusual amongst dryandras, its foliage is glaucous-grey in colour.\nBanksia bella was known as Dryandra pulchella until 2007, when all Dryandra species were transferred to Banksia by Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele. As there was already a plant named Banksia pulchella (Teasel Banksia), Mast and Thiele had to choose a new specific epithet; their choice, \"bella\", is from the Latin bellus (\"beautiful\").",
