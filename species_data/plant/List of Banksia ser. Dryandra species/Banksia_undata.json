    "__SUMMARY__": "Banksia undata, commonly known as urchin dryandra, is a shrub endemic to Western Australia.\nIt was known as Dryandra praemorsa until 2007, when all Dryandra species were transferred to Banksia by Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele. As there was already a plant named Banksia praemorsa (Cut-leaf Banksia), Mast and Thiele were forced to choose a new specific epithet; their choice, \"undata\", is from the Latin undatus (\"undulate\"), in reference to the wavy leaves.\nThere are two varieties: B. undata var. undata and B. undata var. splendens.\nAn assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that its range is likely to contract by between 50% and 80% by 2080, depending on the severity of the change.",
