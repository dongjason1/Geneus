    "__SUMMARY__": "Banksia hewardiana is a shrub endemic to Western Australia. It was first published as Dryandra hewardiana by Carl Meissner in 1856. In 1870, George Bentham published what he held to be a closely related species under the name Dryandra patens, but in 1999 Alex George declared this a synonym of D. hewardiana. In 2007, all Dryandra species were transferred to Banksia by Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele; hence the current name of the species is Banksia hewardiana (Meisn.) A.R.Mast & K.R.Thiele.",
