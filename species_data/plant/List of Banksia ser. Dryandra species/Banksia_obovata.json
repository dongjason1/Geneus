    "__SUMMARY__": "Banksia obovata, commonly known as wedge-leaved dryandra, is a shrub endemic to Western Australia.\nIt was known as Dryandra cuneata until 2007, when all Dryandra species were transferred to Banksia by Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele. As there was already a plant named Banksia cuneata (matchstick banksia), Mast and Thiele had to choose a new specific epithet; their choice, \"obovata\", is from the Latin ob- (\"inverse\") and ovum (\"egg\"), in reference to the obovate leaves.",
