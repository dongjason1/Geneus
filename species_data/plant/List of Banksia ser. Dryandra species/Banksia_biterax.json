    "__SUMMARY__": "Banksia biterax is a shrub endemic to Western Australia.\nIt was known as Dryandra baxteri until 2007, when all Dryandra species were transferred to Banksia by Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele. As there was already a plant named Banksia baxteri (Baxter's banksia), Mast and Thiele were forced to choose a new specific epithet; their choice, \"biterax\", is an anagram of \"baxteri\".",
