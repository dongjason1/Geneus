    "__SUMMARY__": "Banksia serra, commonly known as serrate-leaved dryandra, is a shrub endemic to Western Australia. It was known as Dryandra polycephala until 2007, when all Dryandra species were transferred to Banksia by Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele.\nAn assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that its range is likely to contract by between 30% and 80% by 2080, depending on the severity of the change.",
