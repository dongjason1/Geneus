    "__SUMMARY__": "Banksia strictifolia is a shrub endemic to Western Australia.\nIt was known as Dryandra stricta until 2007, when all Dryandra species were transferred to Banksia by Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele. As the name Banksia stricta had already been published in reference to the plant now known as Pimelea stricta, Mast and Thiele had to choose a new specific epithet. Their choice, \"strictifolia\", maintains the original names' use of the supposed Greek strictus (\"straight and crowded\"), and adds use of the Latin folium (\"leaf\"); the name refers to the straight leaves densely packed on the branches. Strictus is not attested in ancient Greek, but in classical Latin, strictus means \"straight\".\n\n\n== References =="
