    "__SUMMARY__": "Banksia arctotidis is a shrub endemic to Western Australia. It was known as Dryandra arctotidis until 2007, when all Dryandra species were transferred to Banksia by Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele.\nAn assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that its range is likely to contract by between 50% and 80% by 2080, depending on the severity of the change.",
