    "__SUMMARY__": "Banksia cirsioides is a shrub endemic to Western Australia. It was known as Dryandra cirsioides until 2007, when all Dryandra species were transferred to Banksia by Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele.",
    "Description": "Banksia cirsiodes is a small shrub that often grows in a columnar habit, to 2 metres in height. Like many plants in the Dryandra series of Banksia, it has rather stiff, sharp foliage, and produces yellow inflorescences of flowers. The flowering period can be from autumn to spring (May to November).",
