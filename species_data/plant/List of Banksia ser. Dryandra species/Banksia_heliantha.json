    "__SUMMARY__": "Banksia heliantha, commonly known as oak-leaved dryandra, is a shrub endemic to Western Australia.\nIt was known as Dryandra quercifolia until 2007, when all Dryandra species were transferred to Banksia by Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele. As there was already a plant named Banksia quercifolia (oak-leaved banksia), Mast and Thiele had to choose a new specific epithet; their choice, \"heliantha\" is from the Greek helios (\"sun\") and anthos (\"flower\"), in reference to the large, bright yellow inflorescences.",
