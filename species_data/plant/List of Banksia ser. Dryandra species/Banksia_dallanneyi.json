    "__SUMMARY__": "Banksia dallanneyi, commonly known as couch honeypot, is a prostrate shrub endemic to Western Australia. It grows to a height and width of up to 0.5 m, although it is very common for many plants to be growing side by side; thus the clump may be several metres across.\nIt was known as Dryandra lindleyana until 2007, when all Dryandra species were transferred to Banksia by Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele. As there was already a plant named Banksia lindleyana (Porcupine Banksia), Mast and Thiele were forced to choose a new specific epithet; their choice, \"dallanneyi\", is an anagram of \"lindleyana\".\nAn assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that its range is likely to contract by between 30% and 80% by 2080, depending on the severity of the change.Its leaves are 155–265 mm long, 4–6 mm wide, and hairy. Its pistil is 35–40 mm long and straight.",
