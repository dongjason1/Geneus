    "__SUMMARY__": "Pinguicula vulgaris, the common butterwort, is a perennial carnivorous plant in the bladderwort family Lentibulariaceae. It grows to a height of 3–16 cm, and is topped with a purple, and occasionally white, flower that is 15 mm or longer, and shaped like a funnel. This butterwort grows in damp environments such as bogs and swamps, in low or subalpine elevations. It has a generally circumboreal distribution, being native to almost every country in Europe as well as Russia, Canada, and the United States. Being native to environments with cold winters, they produce a winter-resting bud (hibernaculum). There are three forms originating from Europe: P. vulgaris f. bicolor which has petals that are white and purple; P. vulgaris f. albida which has all white petals; and P. vulgaris f. alpicola which has larger flowers. The taxonomic status of these forms is not universally recognised - see e.g. The Plant List.",
