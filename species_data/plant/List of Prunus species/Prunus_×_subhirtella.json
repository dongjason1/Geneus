    "__SUMMARY__": "Prunus subhirtella (Prunus × subhirtella), the winter-flowering cherry, spring cherry, Higan cherry, or rosebud cherry, is a small deciduous flowering tree originating in Japan, but unknown in the wild. It is probably of hybrid origin between Prunus incisa and Prunus spachiana.",
    "Fruit and flowers": "Prunus subhirtella bears white to pink flowers which may emerge intermittently from autumn through to spring, and small black fruit.",
    "Ornamental use": "The leaves of P. subhirtella have some garden value for their autumn colour.The flowers can be used as indoor decorations.Several garden forms are known. The cultivar 'Jugatsu-zakura' (incorrectly known as Prunus × subhirtella 'Autumnalis') is widely grown for its propensity to flower during mild winter weather. The cultivar P. × subhirtella 'Autumnalis Rosea' is widely grown in gardens, and has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.",
