    "__SUMMARY__": "Prunus kuramica is a species of wild almond native to Afghanistan and nearby areas of Pakistan. It is a dense shrub or tree 1 to 5 m tall, with purplish-red hypanthia and sepals, and white or pink petals. It prefers to grow in xeric woodlands with Quercus and Juniper species, typically in rocky ravines at 1800 to 2850 m above sea level. A genetic study showed that is closely related to Prunus bucharica, P. webbii and P. kotschyi, and a full genetic and morphological analysis shows that its closest relative is Prunus bucharica.\n\n\n== References =="
