    "__SUMMARY__": "Prunus pedunculata is a species of Prunus known in China as long‑stemmed almond (长梗扁桃). It is native to China (particularly the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region), Mongolia and nearby sections of Siberia. A small bush, reaching 1-2 m, its pink flowers allow it to be used as an ornamental. Adapted to cold, arid environments, its many‑stemmed growth habit fixes blowing sand, an important contribution to succession. As Amygdalus pedunculatus Pall., it seems to be being evaluated for its seed oil potential.",
