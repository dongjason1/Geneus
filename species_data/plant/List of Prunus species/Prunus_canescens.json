    "__SUMMARY__": "Prunus canescens, the gray-leaf cherry (and hoary cherry, although that name is also used for Prunus incana), is a species of cherry native to China, found in Hubei and Sichuan provinces. A shrubby tree, it grows to about 3 m. It is a parent of a number of hybrid rootstocks for sweet cherries, and occasionally grown as an ornamental for its attractive shiny brown bark.",
    "Hybrids": "Hybrids having P. canescens as a parent include Prunus × schmittii (P. avium × P. canescens), an ornamental tree, and the important GiSeLa dwarfing rootstock series (P. cerasus × P. canescens).",
