    "__SUMMARY__": "Prunus gracilis, called the Oklahoma plum, sour plum, and sand plum, is native to the south-central United States (eastern New Mexico, southeastern Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, southwestern Arkansas, northwestern Louisiana).The specific epithet Gracilis refers to 'slender branches'. Prunus gracilis grows up to 6 ft (1.8 m) tall, has five-petaled leaves, and fruits ripen June–August. Its red fruits are considered poor for eating, but Native Americans dried them for consumption during winter. It grows in clusters and thickets. It is hermaphrodite and pollinated by insects.",
