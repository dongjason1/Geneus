    "__SUMMARY__": "Prunus vachuschtii is a putative species of plum known by the common name in Georgian: ალუჩა, translit.: alucha. It is native to the Caucasus region.",
    "Uses": "In Georgia, it is eaten in hand and is used to make a tart sauce for meat dishes. Although it is probably conspecific with Prunus cerasifera, the cherry plum (in Georgian: ტყემალი, translit.: t'q'emali), Georgians distinguish the two botanically and culinarily. In the Caucasus, P. vachuschtii tends to be found from Caspian sea level up to 500–700 m and P. cerasifera tends to be found at higher elevations, up to 1600–1800 m.",
    "Classification": "N. N. Bregadze, who was apparently quite the splitter, described the species in 1976, and identified three forms; Prunus vachuschtii f. imeretinea, P. v. f. meczibuche, and P. v. f. vachuschtii.",
