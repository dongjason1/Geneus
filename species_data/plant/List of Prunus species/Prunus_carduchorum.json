    "__SUMMARY__": "Prunus carduchorum (Persian: چغالک‎) is a rare species of wild almond native to Turkey, Iraq and Iran, near where the three countries meet. It is a subspinescent shrub 0.5-1.2 m tall. A native of the Eastern Anatolian montane steppe ecoregion, it prefers to grow at 1500 to 3000 m above sea level on marl slopes, in degraded oak forests. Genetically it groups with other scrubby almonds from the region. Based on morphology it was thought to yield Prunus × pabotii when crossed with Prunus haussknechtii.",
    "Etymology": "The specific epithet, carduchorum, means \"of the Carduchi, the wild tribesman of Kurdistan who so severely harried Xenophon and the Ten Thousand\".",
