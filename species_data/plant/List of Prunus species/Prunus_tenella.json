    "__SUMMARY__": "Prunus tenella, dwarf Russian almond, is a species of deciduous shrub in the genus Prunus, native to steppes of Eastern Europe and Western Siberia, as well as dry open sites of Caucasus, Western and Central Asia. In the wild, it tends to grow in clusters of one to three. P. tenella yields small almond-like hairy fruits with characteristic flavor. It grows to 1.5 m (5 ft) and is a popular ornamental plant in cold temperate regions, valued for its profuse spring blossom and exceptional winter hardiness. 'Fire Hill' is a popular cultivar with red flowers.",
