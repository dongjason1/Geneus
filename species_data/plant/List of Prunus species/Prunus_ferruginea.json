    "__SUMMARY__": "Prunus rufa, called Himalayan cherry, is a species of cherry native to Nepal and Burma. It is used as an ornamental elsewhere for its striking shiny brown bark. It has been found growing at 3,925 m (12,900 ft) above sea level in the Himalayas.",
    "Description": "Prunus rufa is a small deciduous tree reaching a height of 15–20 feet (5–6 m). Its calyx tubes are 11–15 mm long and its leaf blades are 2.8–5 cm long. The smooth bark is a shiny brown, with prominent horizontal lenticels, similar to the coppery-red bark of the Tibetan cherry, Prunus serrula and similar to but lighter than the mahogany-brown bark of Prunus himalaica. Its phenotype suggests close affinity with four other Himalayan species of Prunus; P. topkegolensis, P. harae, P. taplejungnica and P. singalilaensis. Some sources consider Prunus ferruginea to be a synonym. \n\n\n== References =="
