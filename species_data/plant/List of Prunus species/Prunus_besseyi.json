    "__SUMMARY__": "Prunus pumila, commonly called sand cherry, is a North American species of cherry in the rose family. It is widespread in eastern and central Canada from New Brunswick west to Saskatchewan and the northern United States from Maine to Montana, south as far as Colorado, Kansas, Indiana, and Virginia, with a few isolated populations in Tennessee and Utah. It grows in sandy locations such as shorelines and dunes.Prunus pumila is a deciduous shrub that grows to 2-6 feet tall depending on the variety.  It forms dense clonal colonies by sprouts from the root system. The leaves are leathery, 4–7 centimetres (1.6–2.8 in) long, with a serrated margin. The flowers are 15–25 millimetres (0.59–0.98 in) in diameter with five white petals and 25–30 stamens.  They are produced in small clusters of two to four. The fruit is a small cherry 13–15 millimetres (0.51–0.59 in) diameter, ripening dark purple in early summer.\nVarietiesPrunus pumila var. besseyi (Bailey) Gleason, western sand cherry (also called Rocky Mountain cherry) - Saskatchewan, Manitoba, western Ontario, south to Colorado and Kansas\nPrunus pumila var. depressa (Pursh) Gleason, eastern sand cherry - Ontario, Québec, New Brunswick south to Pennsylvania\nPrunus pumila var. pumila, Great Lakes sand cherry - shores of Great Lakes\nPrunus pumila var. susquehanae (hort. ex Willd.)
