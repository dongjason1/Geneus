    "__SUMMARY__": "Prunus incisa, the Fuji cherry, gets its scientific name from the deep incisions on the leaves. A dainty slow-growing, early white-flowering cherry, it is a century-old cultigen from Hondo, Japan. It is highly regarded as an ornamental but the wood has no industrial value. It is hardy to -20 °C, and crossed with Prunus speciosa, has yielded the cultivar Prunus 'Umineko'. It is in the ornamental section Pseudocerasus of the cherry subgenus Cerasus of the genus Prunus. Ma et al. classified it in a group with Prunus nipponica.\n\n'Kojo-no-Mai' is a cultivar suitable for the very small garden, as with judicious pruning it can be kept to a maximum size of 1.5–2 m (5–7 ft). In a large pot it will produce a dome of twiggy growth, and has the added bonus of brilliant autumn colour.\n\n\n== References =="
