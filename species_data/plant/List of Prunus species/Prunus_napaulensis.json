    "__SUMMARY__": "Prunus napaulensis is a species of bird cherry native to the eastern foothills of the Himalayas, including Nepal, Myanmar and China. A tree, it can reach 27 m and prefers to grow between 1800 and 3000 m above sea level. The fruit is edible, and it is cultivated for its fruit in Assam (and presumably elsewhere). Its wood is used locally for making furniture. It goes by many common names across its range, including jangali aru and arupate (Nepalese), arupaty (Bengali), sohiong (Khasi), sajong (Assamese) and 粗梗稠李 \"crude stalk thick plum\" (Chinese). Prunus bracteopadus is a very similar species, possibly conspecific.",
