    "__SUMMARY__": "Prunus conradinae is a species of flowering cherry native to Fujian, Gansu, Guangxi, Guizhou, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Yunnan and Zhejiang provinces of China. There it prefers to grow in forested ravines and slopes at 500 to 2100 m above sea level.  A small tree growing to at most 10 m, it has leaves that are lighter green on their undersides. It has fragrant, white to pale pink flowers with 32 to 54 stamens. It is planted outside its native range as an ornamental due to its habit of flowering in late winter. In warmer conditions it may even flower in early January.\n\n\n== References =="
