    "__SUMMARY__": "Shorea ochracea is a species of plant in the Dipterocarpaceae family. The species name is derived from Latin (ochraceus = the colour ochre) and refers to the colour of the undersurface of the leaf. S. ochracea is endemic to Borneo.\nIt is an emergent tree, up to 50 metres (160 ft) tall, in mixed dipterocarp forest on sandy clay soils and claysoils. It is a light hardwood sold under the trade names of White Meranti. S. ochracea is found in at least two protected areas (Lambir & Gunung Mulu National Parks), but is threatened elsewhere due to habitat loss.\n\n\n== References =="
