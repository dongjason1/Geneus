Leaves are densely covered with trichomes when young becoming glabrous with age. Petioles are short (3 cm). Flowers are pistillate inflorescences from 1.5–3 centimetres (0.59–1.18 in) long occurring in March to April. Seeds are oval shaped acorns 1.7–2 centimetres (0.67–0.79 in) long and take 1 year to mature. A cup with trichomes and triangular shaped scales covers 1/4 to 1/3 of the acorn. Bark is grey or reddish-brown with longitudinal furrows.The plant frequently attracts stinkbugs who lay their eggs inside them.",
