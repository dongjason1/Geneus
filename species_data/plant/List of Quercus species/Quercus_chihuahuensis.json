    "__SUMMARY__": "Quercus chihuahuensis, the Chihuahua oak, is a species of oak in the beech family. It is native to the region from extreme western Texas west to Sonora and south to Zacatecas and San Luís Potosí. It grows mostly at mid elevations (400–2000 m) in forests mixed with various pines and other oaks. It is one of the dominant species of the Sierra Madre Occidental in Chihuahua and Sonora.Quercus chihuahuensis is a tree up to 10 meters (33 feet) tall, very common in much of its range. Leaves are entire to toothed or sublobate, green on the top but yellow or gray on the underside because of a coating of velvety, stellate (star-shaped, highly branched) hairs. The species is related to Quercus arizonica and Quercus grisea, sometimes hybridizing with these two species in Texas.\n\n\n== References =="
