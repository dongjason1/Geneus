    "__SUMMARY__": "Quercus laceyi, the Lacey oak, is a small to medium-size deciduous oak tree which is native to northeastern Mexico (Coahuila and Nuevo León) and to the Texas Hill Country in central Texas in the United States.Quercus laceyi seldom grows more than 35 feet (11 meters) tall, and has a stocky trunk. Its blue-green leaves are oblong and shallowly lobed to unlobed, but shade leaves can be deeply lobed; they most often turn yellow or brown in autumn.\nTaxonomyQuercus laceyi has been often confused with Quercus glaucoides, which is an evergreen oak native to central and southern Mexico.",
