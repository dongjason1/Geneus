    "__SUMMARY__": "Quercus buckleyi, commonly known as Texas red oak or Buckley's oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family. It is endemic to the southern Great Plains of the United States (Oklahoma and Texas).Buckley's oak is smaller and more likely to be multitrunked than its close relative, the Shumard oak (Quercus shumardii). The two species are interfertile, and hybrids are common along a line from Dallas to San Antonio, Texas. Texas red oak usually is 30 to 50 ft (9 to 15 m) tall at maturity, and seldom reaches a height of more than 75 ft (23 m).Quercus buckleyi was formerly known as Q. texana, but under botanical rules of priority, that name properly refers to Nuttall's oak. This has led to much confusion.It is a highly regarded ornamental and shade tree. In autumn, the leaves turn vivid red and orange.",
