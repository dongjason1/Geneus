    "__SUMMARY__": "Quercus kerrii is an uncommon Asian species of tree in the family Fagaceae and the \"ring-cupped oak\" sub-genus. It is native to Thailand and Vietnam. There are also populations in southern China that according to some authors belong to Q. kerrii but considered by others to belong to a different species, Q. helferiana.Quercus kerrii is a tree up to 20 m. tall with hairy twigs. Leaves can be as much as 240 mm long.  The acorn is oblate, 7-12 × 20–28 mm, apex depressed to flat, with a scar that is 10–20 mm in diameter and slightly convex. In China, flowering is from March–May, acorns can be found from October–November.This species and Quercus helferiana are closely related: the relationship between them and their distribution needs further work and it is possible that Q. kerrii does not occur in China.",
