    "__SUMMARY__": "Quercus lyrata, the overcup oak, is an oak in the white oak group (Quercus sect. Quercus). It is native to lowland wetlands in the eastern and south-central United States, in all the coastal states from New Jersey to Texas, inland as far as Oklahoma, Missouri, and Illinois. There are historical reports of it growing in Iowa, but the species appears to have been extirpated there.",
    "Description": "Quercus lyrata is a medium-sized deciduous tree, growing to 20 meters (66 feet)  tall, with a trunk up to 80 cm (31 in) in diameter, or rarely to 140 cm (55 in).\nThe leaves are 10–16 cm (4–6 1⁄4 in) long, or rarely to 20 cm (7 3⁄4 in), and 5–10 cm (2–4 in) broad, deeply lobed, often somewhat lyre-shaped (lyrate), dark green above, paler and often finely hairy beneath.\nThe flowers are catkins, produced in the spring and maturing in about 6–7 months into acorns 2.5–5 cm (1–2 in) long and 2–4 cm (3⁄4–1 1⁄2 in) broad, largely enclosed by the cupule (acorn cup).The common name comes from the acorns being largely enclosed in the cup; the scientific name comes from the lyrate (lyre-shaped) leaves.\nThe wood is valuable, similar to that of other white oaks, and used for the same purposes.",
