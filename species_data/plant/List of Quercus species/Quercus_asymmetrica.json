    "__SUMMARY__": "Quercus asymmetrica is the accepted name of an endemic oak tree species in the Asian sub-genus of 'ring-cupped oaks' and the family Fagaceae.  It is found in China (specifically, Guangxi Province and Hainan Province, where it is called 托盘青冈 tuo pan qing gang) and northern Vietnam.",
    "Description": "Quercus asymmetrica is a tree growing up to 15 m tall, with branchlets that are conspicuously angular when young; by second year, they become glabrous with occasional lenticels.\nThe leaves are leathery, elliptic to ovate-lanceolate, 50-120 × 25–60 mm and have 9-11 secondary veins on each side of mid-vein.\nThe acorns are oblate, 25–28 mm in diameter, greyish-brown, with a scar 15–20 mm in diameter, impressed or flat.  The cupules are 20–30 mm in diameter.  A persistent stylopodium is approximately 40 mm in diameter.  In China, flowering is in May–June and acorns may be found in October–November of the following year.",
