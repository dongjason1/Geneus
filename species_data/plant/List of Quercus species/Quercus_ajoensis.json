    "__SUMMARY__": "Quercus ajoensis is an uncommon North American shrub with the common name Ajo Mountain shrub oak. It has been found in Arizona mountain ranges of the Colorado desert and Arizona uplands Sonoran desert . Quercus ajoensis integrates with Quercus turbinella and is difficult to determine specimen identification due to hybridization. It appears that this species is elevation variant of Quercus turbinella and best treated as subspecies or variety as it has been treated in the past. The status of Quercus ajoensis as species is probably unnecessary due to complete integration with Quercus turbinella or just being a low elevation of variant of Quercus turbinella.Quercus ajoensis is a usually a shrub but occasionally attains the stature of small trees up to 3 m (10 feet) tall. Leaves are narrowly egg-shaped, up to 5 cm (2 inches) long, with sharp pointed teeth.The species is named for the Ajo Mountains in western Pima County, Arizona, southwest of the town of Ajo. The species does not occurs as an identifiable species outside the Ajo mountain  range and most of the specimen are of integrated types with Quercus turbinella. The word \"ajo\" is Spanish for \"garlic.\"",
