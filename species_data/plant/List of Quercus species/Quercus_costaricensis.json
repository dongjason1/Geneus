    "__SUMMARY__": "Quercus costaricensis is a species of oak native to Central America (Costa Rica, Honduras, and Panama). It is often found with Quercus copeyensis in the upper montane forests, to 3100 meters elevation. The leaves are tough and leathery with a short petiole and  toothed margin. Wind is the primary pollinator. Squirrels are their main seed predator but also their main disperser as they commonly lose their buried seeds.",
