    "__SUMMARY__": "Quercus acerifolia (also called maple-leaved oak) is a rare North American species of oak in the red oak section Quercus section Lobatae in the beech family. It is endemic to the Ozark Mountains of the State of Arkansas in the south-central United States.The epithet acerifolia means \"maple-leaved.\" The venation of the leaves shows them to be technically pinnately 5-lobed but with the two middle lobes larger than the other three. This makes the leaves appear palmately lobed at first glance, similar to many maples leaves. Quercus acerifolia is a tree sometimes reaching a height of 15 meters (50 feet).The species is threatened by habitat loss.",
