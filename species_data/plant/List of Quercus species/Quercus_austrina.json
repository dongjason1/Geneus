    "__SUMMARY__": "Quercus austrina, the bastard white oak or bluff oak, is an oak species that is endemic to the southeastern United States from Mississippi to the Carolinas, with a few isolated populations in Arkansas.Quercus austrina can grow to a height of 45 to 60 feet (13.5-18.0 meters) with a spread of 35 to 50 feet (10.5-15.0 meters). Leaves are narrow, with shallow rounded lobes. It tends to grow in wet habitats, such as on river bluffs, river bottoms, and flatwoods, and generally over basic substrates, such as mafic rocks, shells, or calcareous sediment.Quercus austrina specimens have often been misidentified as either Q. sinuata or Q. nigra.Quercus aurstina is tolerant to clay, sand, loam, acidic, and well-drained soils. Also, it requires a lot of sun and its drought tolerance is high.\n\n\n== References =="
