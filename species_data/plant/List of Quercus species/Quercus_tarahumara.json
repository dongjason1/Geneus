It grows in the Sierra Madre Occidental in the Mexican States of Chihuahua, Sonora, Durango, and Sinaloa. Some of the populations lie within the territory occupied by the Tarahumara People, after whom the species is named.Quercus tarahumara is a tree up to 10 meters (33 feet) tall. Leaves are rather large for the genus, up to 30 cm (1 foot) across, with the stiffness of cardboard, green on top but tan on the underside. It is sometimes called the \"handbasin oak\" because its size and shape suggest a bathroom sink.",
