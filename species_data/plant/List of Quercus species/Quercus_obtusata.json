    "__SUMMARY__": "Quercus obtusata is an oak in the white oak group (Quercus sect. Quercus) endemic to Mexico, with a distribution ranging from San Luis Potosí and Nayarit south to Oaxaca, from 620 to 2800 MSLQuercus obtusata is a tree up to 20 meters tall with a trunk sometimes more than 60 cm in diameter. Leaves are thick and leathery, up to 22 cm long, widely egg-shaped with 3-9 pairs of shallow rounded lobes or undulations.Resembles Q. potosina which has smaller leaves (3-10 x 2-6 cm); resembles too Q. rugosa, this one has a convex leaf strongly coriaceous, a revolute margin, the epidermis bullate; at least, one can differentiate Q. obtusata from Q. laeta which has foliar underside glaucous, without masses of glandular secretions, none or rare glandular trichomes, a leaf more oblong than oboval with a margin sometimes entire.
