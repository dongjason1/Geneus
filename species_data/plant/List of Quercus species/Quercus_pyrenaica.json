    "__SUMMARY__": "Quercus pyrenaica, commonly known as Pyrenean oak, is a tree native to southwestern Europe and northwestern Africa. Despite its common name, it is rarely found in the Pyrenees Mountains and is more abundant in northern Portugal  and north and northwestern Spain.\nTrees grow slowly to 20 metres (66 ft), or rarely 25 m (82 ft) in optimal conditions. In poor soils, it is often found as a bush or small tree. Roots frequently produce suckers.\nLeaves have short petioles and are deeply and irregularly lobed, with four to eight pairs of lobes per leaf. There are stellate hairs on both sides of the leaf.  Leaves are marcescent, turning brown but remaining on the tree all winter until new leaves emerge in the spring.\nThe oak is cultivated as an ornamental tree for gardens and parks.",
