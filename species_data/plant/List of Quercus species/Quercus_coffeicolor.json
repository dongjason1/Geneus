    "__SUMMARY__": "Quercus coffeicolor is a Mexican species of oak in the beech family. It is native to Nayarit, Sinaloa, and Jalisco in western Mexico.Trelease in 1924 simultaneously published three names for what nearly all present-day botanists consider to be one species. Some publications have referred to this taxon as Quercus prainiana but this name turns out to have been used earlier, in 1913, applied to an Asian species now called Quercus helferiana. Hence this name is not available for the Mexican trees. Instead, more recent authors been using one of Trelease's other names, Quercus coffeicolor.",
    "Description": "Quercus coffeicolor is a tree up to 12 meters tall, with a trunk up to 30 cm in diameter. Leaves elliptical, up to 12 cm long, wavy edges but no teeth or lobes.",
