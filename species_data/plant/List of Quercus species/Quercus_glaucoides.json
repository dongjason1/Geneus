    "__SUMMARY__": "Quercus glaucoides is an oak species in the white oak section, Quercus section Quercus, found in and endemic to eastern, central and southern Mexico (Guanajuato, Guerrero, México State, Hidalgo, Jalisco, Michoacán, Oaxaca, Puebla).",
    "Description": "Quercus glaucoides is primarily a canopy tree in its native habitat. It is an evergreen tree up to  10 meters tall with a trunk diameter over 40 centimeters. Leaves are thick and leathery, up to 15 cm long, with a few shallow rounded lobes.Its scientific name is often misapplied to the NE Mexican and central Texas native Lacey Oak (Quercus laceyi), which has caused great confusion about the true identity of this species and the correct scientific name for the Lacey Oak. Although somewhat related, they do not share the same native range, with Q. glaucoides being endemic to Mexico, while Q. laceyi is native to both NE Mexico and central Texas, and Q. glaucoides is evergreen, while Q. laceyi is deciduous.",
