    "__SUMMARY__": "Quercus arbutifolia is the accepted name of an endemic bush / small-tree species in the Asian sub-genus of 'ring-cupped oaks' and the family Fagaceae; there are no known subspecies.The species appears to be endemic to Vietnam, where it may be called sồi lá trôn. It is reported that there are 5 populations of Quercus arbutifolia in China. But Several populations have experienced severe habitat degradation. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List Categories & Criteria (IUCN 2011), this species qualifies as Vulnerable. Both in situ conservation recommendations, ex situ conservation methods are also necessary to act as an insurance policy against extinction in the short term, and to aid the recovery and support of self-sustaining wild populations in the long term. Strategies such as controlled breeding, vegetative propagation, plant tissue culture, and micro-cuttings could be implemented as additional complementary techniques to prevent extinction. These strategies may be very effective to overcome the limited fruit production and low germination rate in many Q. arbutifolia populations.",
