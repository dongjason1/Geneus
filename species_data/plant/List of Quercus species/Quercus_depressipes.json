In the United States, Q. depressipes has been found only in the Davis Mountains in western Texas, particularly on  Mount Livermore.Other oaks found in the Davis Mountains include the Emory Oak (Quercus emoryi) and Gray Oak (Quercus grisea)Biologists do not have enough information to determine whether Q. depressipes is thriving or threatened.",
