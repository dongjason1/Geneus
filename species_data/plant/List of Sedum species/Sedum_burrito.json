    "__SUMMARY__": "Sedum morganianum, the donkey tail or burro's tail , is  a species of flowering plant in the family Crassulaceae, native to southern Mexico and Honduras. It is a succulent perennial producing trailing stems up to 60 cm (24 in) long, with fleshy blue-green leaves and terminal pink to red flowers in summer.",
    "Cultivation": "With a minimum temperature of 5–7 °C (41–45 °F), in temperate regions S. morganianum is often cultivated as a houseplant in a suspended container, where the trailing stems hang vertically.This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.Sedum morganianum grows well outside or indoors, in very good light but not extreme heat. The plant is best grown in full sunlight for strong growth and to enhance leaf coloration. It requires regular, moderate watering all year, except in winter, when it should be infrequently watered. Excess water can damage the plant in a short time.\nPlants are usually propagated by stem or leaf cuttings. The leaves are quite delicate and will readily break off the stem when manipulated. The leaves will stay alive for many days and roots will emerge after a few days.",
