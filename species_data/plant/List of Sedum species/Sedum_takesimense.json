    "__SUMMARY__": "Sedum takesimense, commonly called Ulleungdo stonecrop or Seomgirincho (Korean: 섬기린초), is a native Korean wild flower that grows on the island of Ulleungdo and the Liancourt Rocks.Sedum takesimense belongs to the stonecrop family and is most commonly found in Ulleungdo. It was given this name because it resembles an imaginary animal with horns, called Girin. It grows in sunny spots between rocks by the sea and blooms with yellow flowers in July. Ulleungdo has unique natural conditions and ecology and is home to many native plants. Due to its geographical proximity, the Liancourt Rocks have many of the same plants.\n\n\n== References =="
