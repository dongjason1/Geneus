    "__SUMMARY__": "Hylotelephium sieboldii (October stonecrop, Siebold's stonecrop, Siebold's sedum or October daphne) is a species of flowering plant in the Crassulaceae family, native to Japan. Growing to 10 cm (4 in) high by 20 cm (8 in) wide, this trailing deciduous perennial produces its round glaucous leaves in whorls of 3 around the delicate stems. The hot-pink flowers appear in autumn (fall).The specific epithet sieboldii commemorates Philipp Franz von Siebold, a notable plant collector of the 19th century.This plant requires some protection from low temperatures in winter, and is often seen in cultivation as a houseplant or in an alpine garden. The cultivar 'Mediovariegatum' with variegated green and cream leaves, has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\n\n== References =="
