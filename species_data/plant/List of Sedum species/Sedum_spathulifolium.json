    "__SUMMARY__": "Sedum spathulifolium is a species of flowering plant in the family Crassulaceae known by the common names broadleaf stonecrop and Colorado stonecrop. An evergreen perennial, it is native to western North America from British Columbia to southern California, where it can be found in many types of rocky habitat in coastal and inland hills and mountains.",
    "Description": "It is quite variable and usually divided into at least two subtaxa. In general, it is a succulent plant producing mats of basal rosettes from a system of rhizomes. The basal leaves are 1 or 2 centimeters long. They are sometimes coated in a waxy, powdery looking exudate. The inflorescence is a short, erect array of many small flowers with yellow petals.\nThe specific epithet spathulifolium refers to the spade-shaped leaves.",
    "Cultivation": "This plant is useful as ornamental groundcover in well-drained soil in full sun. It dislikes winter wet. Numerous cultivars have been selected for garden use, of which 'Cape Blanco' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.",
