Sepals ovate-acute.\nPetals white, with a purple midrib, 5–7 mm, lanceolate, acuminate. Carpels stellate.",
    "Flowering": "March–June.",
    "Habitat": "Rocks.",
    "Distribution": "Coast, lower, middle and upper mountains, Beqaa, Antilebanon.",
    "Geographic area": "Syria, Lebanon, the Palestine region, Western Asia, the Balkans, Italy, and\nSwitzerland.\nNotwithstanding its specific name this stonecrop is not found in Spain. Sedum is the Latin name of the adjoining genus, Sempervivum, houseleek. It is\nderived from sedare, to appease, to tranquillize, since the houseleek cultivated on housetops was supposed to take away the thunder, or probably because the\ncrushed leaves used in plasters have a sedative action.",
