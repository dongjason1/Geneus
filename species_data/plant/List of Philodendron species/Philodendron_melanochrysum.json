    "__SUMMARY__": "Philodendron melanochrysum is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae, endemic to Colombia but widely cultivated elsewhere as an ornamental.One of the best climbing foliage pants for a conservatory, black gold philodendron has heart-shaped leaves that are typically 25 cm long, but in ideal conditions they can grow even longer. Young plants have smaller, broader, copper-red leaves, but when established they are quite superb; they have a velvety sheen on the blackish-green surface, and beautiful, pale green veins. The rare, insignificant flowers are best removed. Grow it up a moss pole and spray regularly to create humidity. Water freely when in full growth and add a monthly liquid feed; water sparingly in winter. Susceptible to scale insects and red spider mites.\n\n\n== References =="
