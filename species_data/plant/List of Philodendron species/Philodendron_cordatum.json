    "__SUMMARY__": "Philodendron cordatum, is a species rarely found or offered as a houseplant. It is native to a small region in Southeastern coastal Brazil,  not far from Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.  It is an epiphytic and epilithic species of Philodendron (growing upon trees or rock outcroppings). This philodendron is typically a vining plant and can tolerate shade.This name is often mistakenly applied to the  popular  houseplant Philodendron hederaceum, (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philodendron_hederaceum) the ivy Philodendron. While \"cordatum\" means heart-shaped and both species have heart-shaped leaves the species name cannot be applied to the ivy Philodendron.",
