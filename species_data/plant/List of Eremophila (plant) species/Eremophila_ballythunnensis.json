    "Description": "Eremophila ballythunnensis is a small, spreading shrub growing to 10–20 cm (4–8 in) high and 25–40 cm (10–20 in) wide. The leaves are arranged alternately, grey-green in colour, narrow oval in shape, 4–12 mm (0.2–0.5 in) long and 2–5 mm (0.08–0.2 in) wide. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a hairy stalk 5–7 mm (0.2–0.3 in) long. There are 5 lance-shaped, densely hairy green sepals which age to a burgundy colour and are 8–12 mm (0.3–0.5 in) long and 2–3 mm (0.08–0.1 in) wide. The petals are purple, 14–20 mm (0.6–0.8 in) long and joined at their lower end to form a flattened, bell-shaped tube which is glabrous inside and out. The 4 stamens are enclosed by the petal tube. Flowering time is mainly from June to August.",

    "Distribution and habitat": "This eremophila is found in the Murchison biogeographic region growing in shallow soil on rocky quartzite hills with Acacia and other Eremophila species.",
    "Conservation": "Eremophila ballythunnensis has been classified as \"Priority One\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk.\n\n\n== References =="
