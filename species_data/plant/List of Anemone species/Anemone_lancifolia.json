    "__SUMMARY__": "Anemone lancifolia, the lanceleaf anemone or mountain thimbleweed, is an herbaceous plant species in the genus Anemone and family Ranunculaceae. Plants grow 20 to 30 cm tall, growing from a horizontally orientated rhizome, flowering mid spring to early summer. The flowers have white sepals that are 12–20 mm long. This species much resembles Anemone quinquefolia except that it is larger growing. After flowering fruits called achenes are formed in a small cluster, each achene is 3.5–5 mm long, lacks wings and has a straight or partly curved beak that is 1-1.5 mm long.\nBoth the Latin and common names reference the leaf shape, which is thinner and with distinctive serration when compared with the wood anemone (Anemone quinquefolia).\nNative to the eastern United States in the states of North and South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia. \nAnemone lancifolia is normally found growing in rich damp soils in woods.\n\n\n== References =="
