    "__SUMMARY__": "Anemone drummondii is a species of anemone known by the common name Drummond's anemone. This wildflower is native to western North America from California to Alaska. It is a squat perennial with short erect stems and small, soft, wrinkled leaves. Each clumping plant produces several showy flowers, each with five to eight petal-like sepals but no petals. The sepals are usually white, often with a distinct blue tint. The flower center is filled with many yellow-anthered stamens. The fruits are woolly achenes. This is a plant of mountainous environments such as the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada, extending from the coniferous forests to alpine elevations.",
