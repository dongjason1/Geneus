    "__SUMMARY__": "Anemone hortensis, commonly called broad-leaved anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant with an underground rhizome, belonging to the genus Anemone of the family Ranunculaceae. The genus name comes from the Greek ἄνεμος (ánemos, meaning \"wind\"), as an ancient legend tells that the flowers open only when the wind blows. The species name hortensis (from Latin hortus, meaning \"vegetable garden\") refers to the easiness with which this plant can be cultivated.",
    "Description": "Anemone hortensis reaches on average 20–40 centimetres (7.9–15.7 in) of height. The stem is erect and pubescent. The basal leaves have a petiole  5–10 centimetres (2.0–3.9 in) long and are palmate or “hand-shaped”, with 3-5 toothed lobes. The solitary flowers are fragrant and range in color from white-bluish or mauve to red-purple, with a diameter of 3–6 centimetres (1.2–2.4 in). They have 12-20 lanceolate and acute petals, with numerous bluish or violet stamens and blue anthers. The flowering period extends from March through May. This plant is pollinated by wind or dispersed by animals.",
