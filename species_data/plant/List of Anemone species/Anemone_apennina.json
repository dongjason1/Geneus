    "__SUMMARY__": "Anemone apennina, the Apennine anemone or blue anemone, is a rhizomatous perennial plant in the genus Anemone in the family Ranunculaceae. It is native to southern central Europe, taking its name from the Apennine Mountains, but widely naturalised elsewhere in Europe, including the United Kingdom. It can be confused with Anemone nemorosa which it resembles. It grows to 20 cm. In early spring it produces single blue flowers above ferny foliage, which dies down in summer. It is especially valued for its ability to colonise deciduous woodland.\nThis plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\n\n== References =="
