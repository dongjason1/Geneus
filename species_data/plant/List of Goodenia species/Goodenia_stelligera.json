    "__SUMMARY__": "Goodenia stelligera, commonly referred to as spiked goodenia, is a flowering plant that is endemic to Australia.\nThis species has an erect stem, up to 40 cm (16 in) tall. It is a tufted, perennial herb with leaves forming a rosette around the base of the plant. Leaves are thick, linear to oblanceolate, up to 5–25 cm long and about 1-12mm wide, sometimes entire, but usually toothed. Stem leaves are reduced or absent. The yellow, tubular flowers are 13 to 16mm long, with whitish and yellow star shaped hairs outside of the yellow petals. Flowers appear mainly in spring and summer, in the species' native range. Fruits are ovoid to oblong capsules, 5–9 mm long opening to release elliptic brown seeds about 1.5mm long. The species occurs in wet heath along the coastal zone of New South Wales, and southern Queensland .The species was first formally described in 1810 by botanist Robert Brown in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae.\n\n\n== References =="
