    "__SUMMARY__": "Goodenia albiflora, commonly referred to as the white goodenia, is a rhizomatous herb native to the Adelaide region of southern Australia.Leaves are a blue-green in colour and alternate up the stem. They range from 2-4 centimetres long, have prominent veins and serrations on the side, and have pointed tips. They are semi-succulent.\nSpectacular masses of blue-white flowers form in spring and early summer. These are in the typical Goodenia hand shape, and are approximately 2 centimetres in diameter. These flowers make it an important food plant for native insects such as butterflies. Flowers are replaced by papery capsules containing several 5mm wide disc shaped seeds.\nGoodenia albiflora is hard to grow from seed, but much easier from cuttings or rhizome sections. It prefers well drained, lime rich soils, and is a useful plant for steep slopes and cuttings because of its good soil binding properties.\n\n\n== References =="
