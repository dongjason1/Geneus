    "__SUMMARY__": "Antirrhinum coulterianum (syn. Sairocarpus coulterianus) is a species of New World snapdragon known by the common name Coulter's snapdragon.\nIt is native to southern California and Baja California, where it grows in desert shrublands and in the coastal hills and mountains, especially in areas that have recently burned.",
    "Description": "Antirrhinum coulterianum is an annual herb producing an erect stem which often clings to objects or other plants for support. It is mostly hairless, except for the inflorescence at the top, which can be quite woolly.\nLeaves are sparse and generally linear and there is often a basal rosette of leaves at the base of the stem; this is the only Antirrhinum that forms such a rosette.\nThe top of the mostly naked stem is occupied by a raceme inflorescence of white snapdragon flowers, which are often tinted with lavender or pink, especially when newly opened. Each flower is about a centimeter wide.",
