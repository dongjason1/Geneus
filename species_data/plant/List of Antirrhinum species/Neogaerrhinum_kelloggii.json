    "__SUMMARY__": "Antirrhinum kelloggii (syn. Neogaerrhinum kelloggii) is a species of New World snapdragon known by the common name Kellogg's snapdragon.\nIt is native to the coastal hills and mountain ranges of California and Baja California. It grows in many local plant communities, especially in areas that have recently burned. This is a thin, sprawling annual herb which sometimes becomes vine-like, climbing nearby objects or other plants. The inflorescence consists of a solitary flower on a very long, strongly coiling pedicel up to 9 centimeters long. The flower at the tip is a dark-veined purple snapdragon over a centimeter wide. The fruit is a dehiscent capsule containing many bumpy seeds.",
