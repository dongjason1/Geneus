Stems, flower stalks and branches also spiky. The leaf stem is around 1 cm long. Flowers are typical of the Australian Solanum group, being purple to blue with a yellow centre, appearing in spring. The fruit is pale yellow green berry with darker green markings. It's around 25 to 30 mm in diameter, on a stem 2 to 5 cm long.\nThe habitat is moist areas, in sclerophyll forest, or disturbed areas in rainforest.
