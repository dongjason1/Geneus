    "__SUMMARY__": "Solanum sarrachoides is a species of nightshade known as the hairy nightshade or leafy-fruited nightshade. In California, according to the Jepson Manual Solanum key, it is differentiated by its calyx (sepals) that are enlarged during fruit, but smaller when in flower.\nThe scientific name S. sarrachoides was long misused for a different species, Solanum physalifolium, by various authors. The original misidentified S. sarrachoides were held to be the variety S. physalifolium var. nitidibaccatum (also treated as distinct species, Solanum nitidibaccatum'). The actual S. sarrachoides was also considered a variety of S. tweedianum, under this plant's obsolete name S. atriplicifolium, as established by Gilli based on Nees.",
