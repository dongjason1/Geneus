    "__SUMMARY__": "Solanum quadriloculatum is known under the (ambiguous) common names of \"bush tomato\" or (in Australia)  \"wild tomato\". It is a small fruiting shrub in the family Solanaceae. It was and occasionally still is included in S. ellipticum by some authors, but generally these two species of \"bush tomatoes\" are considered distinct nowadays.It is native to Australia, where it is found primarily in shrubby eucalypt woodland and arid-zone shrublands.",
