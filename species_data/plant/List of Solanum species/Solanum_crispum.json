    "__SUMMARY__": "Solanum crispum is a species of flowering plant in the  family Solanaceae, native to Chile and Peru. Common names include Chilean potato vine, Chilean nightshade, Chilean potato tree and potato vine. Growing to 6 m (20 ft) tall, it is a semi-evergreen, woody-stemmed climbing plant. The small blue fragrant flowers, 2.5 cm in diameter, with prominent yellow ovaries, appear in clusters in summer. They resemble those of the closely related potato. Very small poisonous berries are produced in autumn. The berries start out green, then yellow-orange, and finally purple.  The leaves are oval.\nThe specific epithet crispum means \"closely curled\".",
    "Cultivation": "S. crispum is grown as a garden plant. The free-flowering cultivar 'Glasnevin' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.The plant is fast-growing with a long flowering period, typically from midsummer till autumn (fall). It grows well in neutral or slightly alkaline soils that are moist and well drained. Requiring some protection from frost, planting it against a south- or west-facing fence or wall in full sun is recommended.There is a white form known as 'Album'.",
