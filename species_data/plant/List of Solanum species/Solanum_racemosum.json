S. bahamense is known by many junior synonyms and involved in several cases of homonymy.Some additional varieties of S. bahamense have been described, but they are not considered taxonomically distinct today:\nSolanum bahamense var. inerme Dunal\nSolanum bahamense var. lanceolatum Griseb. (Not to be confused with S. lanceolatum.)\nSolanum bahamense var. luxurians D'Arcy\nSolanum bahamense var. rugelii D'Arcy\nSolanum bahamense var. subarmatum (Willd.) O.E.Schulz\n\n\n== References =="
