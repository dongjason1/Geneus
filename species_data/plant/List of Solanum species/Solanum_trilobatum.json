    "__SUMMARY__": "Solanum trilobatum, also called as solanum (Tamil: தூதுவளை), is an herb that can be consumed by mildly frying it in oil or ghee and then grinding it.\nThe plant is full of thorns, including the leaves.   It is important to remove these thorns before cooking as the thorns are considered to be mildly toxic. The herb can be stored in powdered form by drying the leaves under shade and making a powder out of it. It is used to treat fever and common cold.It is found in India and some tropical countries\n=",
