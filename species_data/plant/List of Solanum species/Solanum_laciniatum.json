It also occurs in Western Australia and New Zealand, where some authorities consider it to be introduced.  It is similar to Solanum aviculare, with which it shares the common name kangaroo apple.\nThe shrub typically grows to a height of 1 to 4 m (3 ft 3 in to 13 ft 1 in) and blooms between January and February producing purple blue flowers.\n\n\n== References =="
