    "__SUMMARY__": "Asparagus capensis, also called katdoring (from the Afrikaans for 'cat-thorn') is a dense, thorny, shrub of the Asparagus genus, that is indigenous to South Africa and Namibia.\nThis species of asparagus grows as a thorny bush, to a height of 1 metre. The leaves are small and spiny and the tiny, white, scented flowers appear from autumn to spring.\nIts natural range is throughout the Cape, from Namibia southwards to Cape Town and eastwards to the Eastern Cape.\nLike many other Asparagus species, the young shoots of this plant are edible, and are eaten by local people.",
