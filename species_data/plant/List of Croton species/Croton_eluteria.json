It grows to be a small tree or tall shrub, rarely reaching 20 feet in height. Its leaves are scanty, alternate, ovate-lanceolate, averaging 2 inches long, with close scaling below, giving a metallic silver-bronze appearance, and scattered white scales above. The flowers are small, with white petals, and very fragrant, appearing in March and April. The scented bark is fissured, pale yellowish brown, and may be covered in lichen.Tincture from the bark is used as a tonic and stimulant, and a fever reducer.  Cascarilla bark is also used to flavour the liqueurs Campari and Vermouth.",
