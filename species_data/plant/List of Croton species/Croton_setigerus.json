    "__SUMMARY__": "Croton setigerus (formerly Eremocarpus setigerus) is a species of plant known by the common names dove weed and turkey mullein. It is native to western North America, such as  Montana and California. It has naturalized elsewhere, including parts of Australia.\nThis is a squat plant with furry, feltlike, hexagon shaped leaves, pale pink green in color. The small green flowers are covered in soft bristles.",
    "Cultivation": "Croton setigerus is used as an ornamental plant, its low and rounded form fills a pot.\nThe foliage is toxic to animals, and the crushed plants were used by Native Americans to stupefy fish and make them easy to catch. When crushed, the leaves have a sweet odor that some find unpleasant.\nHowever, the seeds are very palatable to birds. The common names of the plant come from the affinity of doves and wild turkeys for the seeds.",
