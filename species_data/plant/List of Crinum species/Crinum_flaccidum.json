    "__SUMMARY__": "Crinum flaccidum, known variously as the Darling lily, Murray lily or Macquarie lily, is a species of the family Amaryllidae native to inland Australia.The 1889 book 'The Useful Native Plants of Australia records that the Indigenous people of the Cloncurry area of North Queensland referred to this plant as Boomarrah that \"Sir Thomas Mitchell, in one of his western trips, speaks of this plant growing in such abundance that the whole country seemed strewed with the fruit, which was then ripe, and of which the natives [sic.] ate great quantities, and were very fond. It is about the size of a plum only. In the Treasury of Botany it is observed that the tender tops\nof all the edible species of Cucurbilacece, boiled as greens or spinach, are even a more delicate vegetable than the fruit.\"\n\n\n== References =="
