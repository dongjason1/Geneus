    "__SUMMARY__": "Coccothrinax clarensis is a palm which is endemic to central and eastern Cuba. Its name suggests that it has small coconut-like fruit (Greek coccos:berry and thrinax:trident or winnowing fork) while clarensis comes from Santa Clara valley in Cuba where the species are found.\nTwo subspecies are recognised: Coccothrinax clarensis subsp. brevifolia (León) Borhidi & O.Muñiz and Coccothrinax clarensis subsp. clarensisHenderson and colleagues (1995) considered C. clarensis subsp. clarensis to be a synonym of Coccothrinax gundlachii and C. clarensis subsp. brevifolia to be a synonym of Coccothrinax pauciramosa.\n\n\n== References =="
