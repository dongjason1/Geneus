    "__SUMMARY__": "Coccothrinax inaguensis, the thatch palm or Inagua silver palm, is a palm which is endemic to the Bahamas.Henderson and colleagues also considered Coccothrinax victorini to be a possible conspecific.  If that is the case, the name C. victorini should be applied to the combined species, since that name was the first to be published.\n\n\n== References =="
