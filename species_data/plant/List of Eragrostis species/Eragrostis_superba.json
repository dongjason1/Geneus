    "__SUMMARY__": "Eragrostis superba is a species of perennial tufted grass in the family Poaceae. It is a palatable forage species but occurs at low densities.\nIt occurs from Sudan to South Africa, and flowers during the rainy season. The large, flat and oval-shaped spikelets are carried in long panicles. They have serrated edges and a purple or pinkish hue when fresh. It is native to sandy soils in open woodlands or sparse grassland, up to about 1,500 m in altitude, or occurs as a pioneer in disturbed areas.",
