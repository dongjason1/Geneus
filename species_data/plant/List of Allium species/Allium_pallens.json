    "__SUMMARY__": "Allium pallens is a species of wild onion native to the Mediterranean region and Middle East from Portugal and Algeria to Iran.",
    "Description": "Allium pallens produces a single egg-shaped bulb. Scape is up to 50 cm tall, round in cross-section. Leaves are long, narrow, and fleshy. Flowers are bell-shaped, some nodding while others in the same umbel erect, the tepals white or pale purple with prominent green or purple midveins.",
    "Taxonomy": "A. paniculatum is placed within section Codonoprasum, subgenus Allium. There is some degree of uncertainty with regards to the relationships of taxa within the section. The Plant List gives A. pallens as an accepted name, but The World Checklist of Selected Plant Families treats it as a subspecies of Allium paniculatum, Allium paniculatum subsp. pallens (L.) K.Richt. Furthermore a number of synonyms listed in The Plant List, such as Allium sternii, are treated as separate species by The World Checklist.\nTaxa formerly included\nAllium pallens var. grandiflorum, now called Allium litardierei\nAllium pallens var. pseudooleraceum, now called Allium oleraceum\nAllium pallens var. savii, now called Allium savii\nAllium pallens subsp. siciliense , now called Allium lehmannii\nAllium pallens subsp. tenuiflorum , now called Allium tenuiflorum\n\n\n== References =="
