The flowers appear in April and May, in a variety of colors ranging from white to pink.  It is common, considered invasive in some regions.",
    "Uses": "This species of Allium is gathered by Native Americans for its small edible bulbs.  These contain a considerable amount of inulin, a non-reducing sugar that humans cannot digest.  Because of this, these onions must be heated for a long period of time in order to convert the inulin into digestible sugars.\n\n\n== References =="
