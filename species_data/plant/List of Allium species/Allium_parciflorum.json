It is common at all elevations on those two islands but unknown elsewhere.Allium parciflorum has egg-shaped bulbs. Scape is up to 25 cm tall, round in cross-section. Leaves are thin and tubular, about the same length as the scape but withering before flowering time. Umbels have very few bell-shaped flowers. Tepals are white to pale lavender with prominent dark purple midveins.Allium parciflorum is closely related to Allium lojaconoi, endemic to Malta.\n\n\n== References =="
