    "Description": "Allium nevii produces egg-shaped bulbs up to 2 cm across. One plant will generally have 1-3 scapes, each round or slightly flattened and up to 25 cm tall. Flowers are in umbels of as many as 30 flowers, each bell-shaped and about 7 mm across. Tepals are rose-colored; anthers and pollen blue.",
    "Taxonomy": "Historically A. nevii was treated as part of the A. douglasii alliance. Both A. douglasii and A. nevii were placed in the Ownbey Allium falcifolium alliance and subsequently by Traub in subsection Falcifolia, section Lophioprason, subgenus Amerallium (see Taxonomy of Allium).",
