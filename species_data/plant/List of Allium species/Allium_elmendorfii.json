    "__SUMMARY__": "Allium elmendorfii is a species of wild onion endemic to Texas. It is known only from Bexar, Frio, Wilson, and Atascosa Counties. It is generally found on sandy soils, specifically \"well-drained sands, Eocene, Pleistocene and Holocene sands, and has only a 400 x 160 km range.\" Its habitat is \"Forest/Woodland, Savanna, Woodland - Hardwood\" and specifically \"{g}rassland openings in post oak (Quercus stellata) woodlands on deep, well-drained sands derived from Queen City and similar Eocene formations.\"Allium elmendorfii is a perennial bulb-forming herb with clusters of small bulbils around the roots, but without the dry papery outer layers that the domesticated onions have. It has an umbel of 10-30 erect to spreading flowers, each with 6 white to pinkish tepals about 5 cm (2 inches) long, flowering from March to April or May.",
    "Distribution": "",
    "Uses": "Allium elmendorfii is related to the common domesticated onion, Allium cepa L., and has a similar aroma. It can be eaten in the same manner, as can most of the members of the genus.",
