    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia clydonophora is a shrub belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Phyllodineae that is endemic to Western Australia.",
    "Description": "The singled stemmed, openly ranched and slender shrub typically grows to a height of 0.7 to 1.5 metres (2 to 5 ft). It has prominently striate-ribbed branchlets. The green, oblique phyllodes have an elliptic to narrowly elliptic shape although some have a obovate to oblanceolate or even lanceolate shape. The phyllodes are straight or slightly recurved with a length of 4 to 12 cm (1.6 to 4.7 in) and a width of 1.5 to 3 cm (0.59 to 1.18 in). It blooms from April to November and produces creamy-yellow flowers. The inflorescences occur in clusters of 3 to 14 headed racemes with loosely packed spherical flower-heads containing five to seven cream to creamy yellow. The erect linear to curved woody seed pods that form after flowering have a length of around 7 cm (2.8 in) and a width of 4 to 5 mm (0.16 to 0.20 in). The shiny dark brown narrowly oblong seeds inside are 5 to 6 mm (0.20 to 0.24 in) in length.",
    "Distribution": "It is native to an area along the west coast in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia between Dandaragan in the north to Chittering in the south where it is found on and among breakaways and lateritic ridges growing in sandy or loamy soils over lateritic gravel.",
