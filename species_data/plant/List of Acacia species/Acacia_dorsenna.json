    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia dorsenna is a shrub belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Phyllodineae that is endemic to Western Australia.\nThe dense domed shrub typically grows to a height of 1.0 to 1.6 metres (3 to 5 ft) and 3.0 metres (10 ft) wide. The smooth dull green phyllodes have an elliptic to obovate shape. The phyllodes are around 10 to 15 mm (0.39 to 0.59 in) in length and have a width of 5 to 9 mm (0.20 to 0.35 in) with obscure midrib and lateral nerves. It blooms from August to September producing yellow flowers. The inflorescences are found in groups of seven to ten. The spherical flower-heads contain 15 to 21 bright golden yellow flowers. The narrowly oblong brown seed pods that form after flowering have a length of around 6 cm (2.4 in) and a width of 11 mm (0.43 in). The oblong-elliptic shaped seeds have a length of up to 4 mm (0.16 in).It is a member of the Acacia prainii and resembles Acacia camptoclada and some forms of Acacia merrallii.It is native to a small area in the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia in a small area in the Dundas where it is found on low rocky hills growing in rocky sandy-loam-clay soils. Only two populations of the shrub are known both of which are located about 25 km (16 mi) to the north of Norseman in mallee or shrubland communities.",
