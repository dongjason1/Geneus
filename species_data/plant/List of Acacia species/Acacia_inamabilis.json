    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia inamabilis is a shrub belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Phyllodineae that is native to Western Australia.",
    "Description": "The spreading pungent shrub typically grows to a height of 0.2 to 1.3 metres (0.7 to 4.3 ft). It has stout, green, mostly glabrous branchlets with fine yellow ribbing and spinose straight stipules that have a length of 2.5 to 5 mm (0.098 to 0.197 in). The patent to ascending, pungent, rigid, thick, green phyllodes are straight or shallowly curved. The phyllodes are pentagonal in cross-section and have a length of 20 to 45 mm (0.79 to 1.77 in) and a diameter of around 1.5 mm (0.059 in). It produces yellow flowers from August to September.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was first formally described in 1904 by the botanist Ernst Georg Pritzel as part of the work between Pritzel and Ludwig Diels Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae occidentalis. Beitrage zur Kenntnis der Pflanzen Westaustraliens, ihrer Verbreitung und ihrer Lebensverhaltnisse as published in Botanische Jahrbücher für Systematik, Pflanzengeschichte und Pflanzengeographie. It was reclassified as Racosperma inamabile in 2003 by Leslie Pedley then transferred back to the genus Acacia in 2006.A. inamabilis is closely related to Acacia concolorans, but is sometimes mistaken for Acacia calcarata.",
    "Distribution": "It has a scattered distribution in the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia from around Mount Malcolm in the Fraser Range in the east past Norseman in the west and to the south around Peak Charles National Park. It is often found around granite boulders and outcrops and salt lakes growing in sandy and loamy soils usually as a part of open Eucalyptus woodland or mallee communities.",
