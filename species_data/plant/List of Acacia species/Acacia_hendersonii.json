    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia hendersonii is a shrub belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Phyllodineae that is native to parts of north eastern Australia.",
    "Description": "The glabrous and resinous shrub typically grows to a height of up to 3 m (9.8 ft) and has a spreading habit. It has slender, prominently ribbed branchlets. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The flat, thick and evergreen phyllodes have a linear shape and are 6 to 22 mm (0.24 to 0.87 in) in length and 0.7 to 1.1 mm (0.028 to 0.043 in) wide and are straight or slightly decurved at the apex with one prominent vein on each face. When it blooms it produced simple inflorescences occur singly in the axils and have spherical flower-heads containing 30 to 35 yellow coloured flowers.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was first formally described by the botanist Leslie Pedley in 1999 as part of the work Notes on Acacia (Leguminosae: Mimosoideae) chiefly from northern Australia as published in the journal Austrobaileya.",
    "Distribution": "The shrub has a limited distribution on the Blackdown tableland area of the Central Highlands Region of Queensland where it is found on sandstone plateaus growing in skeletal sandy soils among Eucalyptus and Acacia woodland communities.",
