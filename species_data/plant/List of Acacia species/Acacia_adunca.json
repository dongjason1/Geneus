The phyllodes are dark green and lustrous and feel oily to touch. It produces masses of golden ball flowers from late winter to early spring. The flowers are borne on simple racemes that are about 30 mm (1.2 in) long and form near the terminus of the branchlets.A. adunca has a range that extends from the tablelands of southern Queensland to northern New South Wales.",
