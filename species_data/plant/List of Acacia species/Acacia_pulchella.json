    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia pulchella, commonly known as prickly moses, is a shrub in the family Fabaceae.  Endemic to Western Australia, it is one of the most common shrubs of the bushland around Perth and in the Darling Range.\nPrickly moses is one of only a small number of Acacia species to have true leaves, rather than phyllodes.  It has feathery, bipinnate leaves with leaflets up to 5 mm long.  At the base of each leaf is one or two spines.  The flower heads are bright yellow and spherical, with a diameter of up to 1 cm.  It flowers in late winter and early spring.\nThe name \"prickly moses\" is said to be a corruption of \"prickly mimosa\".\nRecent research suggests that A. pulchella may in some circumstances suppress the plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi.There are four recognised varieties:\n\nA. p. var. glaberrima\nA. p. var. goadbyi\nA. p. var. pulchella\nA. p. var. reflexa",
    "Uses": "This prickly shrub is useful as a screen to inhibit animal and human access to areas.",
