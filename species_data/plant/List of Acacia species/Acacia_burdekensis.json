    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia burdekensis is a tree belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Juliflorae that is native to north eastern Australia.",
    "Description": "The tree typically grows to a height of less than 9 m (30 ft) and scurfy, resinous reddish-brown coloured branchlets. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The evergreen, glabrous phyllodes are straight to very falcate and are at there widest just below the middle. They are 7 to 14 cm (2.8 to 5.5 in) in length and 7 to 18 mm (0.28 to 0.71 in) and have parallel longitudinal nerves that are crowded together usually with two or three more prominent than the others. When it blooms it produces simple inflorescences along spikes with a length of 25 to 60 mm (0.98 to 2.36 in) that are moderately packed with yellow flowers. After flowering it produces linear Seed pods that are slightly constricted between the seeds. The glabrous dark brown pods are straight to shallowly curved with a width of 3 to 4 mm (0.12 to 0.16 in) with longitudinally arranged seeds inside.",
    "Distribution": "It has only a limited range in northern parts of the Burdekin River watershed in Queensland where it is found on hillsides and along creek banks growing in stony and sandy soils.",
