    "Description": "The spreading viscid shrub or tree typically grows to a height of 2.4 to 3 metres (8 to 10 ft) and to a width of around 4 m (13 ft). It blooms from September to November and produces yellow flowers. The obliquely widely elliptic to elliptic phyllodes are 1.5 to 3 centimetres (1 to 1 in) long and 11 to 22 millimetres (0.4 to 0.9 in) wide. The simple inflorescences have globular flower heads with a diameter of 5 to 6 mm (0.20 to 0.24 in) containing 54 to 60 golden flowers. The seed pods that form later are straight to narrowly oblong. They have a length of around 2.2 cm (0.87 in) and a width of 3 to 5 mm (0.12 to 0.20 in) and contain glossy brown oblong-elliptic seeds.",
