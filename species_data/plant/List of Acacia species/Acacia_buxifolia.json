The plant has an erect habit with glabrous, flattened and angled branchlets. It has phyllodes that are 10 to 45 mm (0.39 to 1.77 in) in length and 2 to 11 mm (0.079 to 0.433 in) wide.  The bright yellow spherical flowerheads appear in groups of 2 to 14 in the axils of the phyllodes from July to November in the species' native range, followed by straight or curved seed pods which are 30 to 70 mm (1.2 to 2.8 in) long and 5 to 8 mm (0.20 to 0.31 in).",

It was reclassified as Racosperma buxifolium in 1987 by Leslie Pedley and transferred back to genus Acacia in 2006.\nTwo subspecies are known;\n\nAcacia buxifolia subsp. buxifolia\nAcacia buxifolia subsp. pubiflora.",
