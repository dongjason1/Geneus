    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia carnosula is a shrub belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Phyllodineae that is endemic to an area along the south coast of Western Australia. \nThe spreading domed shrub typically grows to a height of 0.5 to 1.5 metres (2 to 5 ft). It has glabrous branchlets that have a rough surface of bark shedding into irregular flakes. The ascending to erect phyllodes have an obovate to oblanceolate shape with a length of 5 to 10 mm (0.20 to 0.39 in) and a width of 1 to 2.5 mm (0.039 to 0.098 in). The simple inflorescences occur singly or as pairs per axil. The spherical flower-heads have a diameter of around 3 mm (0.12 in) and contain 9 to 11 light golden flowers. The linear seed pods that form after flowering are slightly constricted between the seeds. The dark red-brown pods have a length of 4 cm (1.6 in) and a width of 2.5 to 3.5 mm (0.098 to 0.138 in). It blooms from July to October and produces yellow flowers.It is native to an area along the south coast of the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia east of Cape Arid into the western parts of the Nullarbor Plain, where it is found on dunes and limestone rises growing in sandy to clay-loamy soils. The range is mostly between Caiguna and Cocklebiddy, with one population near Israelite Bay.",
