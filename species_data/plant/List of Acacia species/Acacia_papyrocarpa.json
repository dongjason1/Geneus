    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia papyrocarpa, commonly known as western myall, is a tree in the family Fabaceae.  Endemic to Australia, it occurs on limestone plains in southern Australia from Paynes Find in Western Australia eastwards into South Australia.  There is also an anomalous specimen at Cooper Creek in Queensland. A weeping form of the species that grows at Roxby Downs, South Australia bears the common name water myall.\nWestern myall grows as an upright tree to seven metres high.  Like most Acacia species, it has phyllodes rather than true leaves.  These are greyish-green in colour, straight and flat, between four and twelve centimetres long and one to two millimetres wide.  The flowers are yellow, and held in spherical clusters about five millimetres in diameter.  The pods are thin and flat, about eleven centimetres long and four to ten millimetres wide.",
