    "Description": "The dense low spreading shrub typically grows to a height of 0.1 to 0.3 metres (0.33 to 0.98 ft) and 0.3 to 1.5 m (0.98 to 4.9 ft) wide. Branchlets are covered in tiny hairs and have linear stipules that are 2 to 6 millimetres (0.079 to 0.236 in) long. The phyllodes have an elliptic to lanceolate shape nd are 1 to 3 centimetres (0.39 to 1.18 in) long and 2 to 12 mm (0.079 to 0.472 in) wide. It blooms from September to December and produces cream-yellow flowers.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was first formally described by the botanist George Bentham in 1855 as part of the work Plantae Muellerianae: Mimoseae as published journal Linnaea: ein Journal für die Botanik in ihrem ganzen Umfange, oder Beiträge zur Pflanzenkunde. It was reclassified as Racosperma crispulum in 2003 by Leslie Pedley and transferred back to the genus Acacia in 2006.",
    "Distribution": "It is native to an area along the south coast in the Goldfields-Esperance and Great Southern regions of Western Australia where it grows in sandy, clay, loamy and gravelly soils.
