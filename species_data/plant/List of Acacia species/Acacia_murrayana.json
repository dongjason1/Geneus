    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia murrayana is a tree in the family Fabaceae.  It has numerous common names, including sandplain wattle, Murray's wattle, fire wattle, colony wattle and powder bark wattle.  It is widespread throughout Australia's arid zone, occurring on sand ridges and in disturbed areas in every mainland State except Victoria.\nSandplain wattle grows as a tall shrub or small tree, up to eight metres in height.  Like most Acacia species, it has phyllodes rather than true leaves.  They are grey or pale green, between five and twelve centimetres long and two to seven millimetres wide.  The flowers are bright yellow, and held in cylindrical clusters up to eight millimetres in diameter.  The pods are flat and papery, five to eight centimetres long and up to one centimetre wide.",
