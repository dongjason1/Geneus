    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia macraneura, commonly known as big mac wattle, is a shrub belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Juliflorae that is native to arid parts of western Australia.",
    "Description": "The multi-stemmed shrub typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 m (6 ft 7 in to 16 ft 5 in) with a spreading habit but it is occasionally found as an obconic tree with a height of 4 to 7 m (13 to 23 ft) that has crooked stems and branches. The slightly hairy branchlets often have obscure resinous ribbing near the extremities. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The green to grey-green phyllodes have a blueish coloured tinge and are incurved or sigmoid to sinuous. The usually terete phyllodes have a length of 4 to 9 cm (1.6 to 3.5 in) and a diameter of 0.8 to 1.1 mm (0.031 to 0.043 in) with many obscure longitudinal nerves.",
    "Distribution": "It is endemic to the Mid West and Pilbara regions of Western Australia. It has a scattered distribution from around Mount Magnet in the south west to around Leonora in the south east to the Pilbara region and around the Rudall River catchment and the Little Sandy Desert with smaller populations close to the border with South Australia.",
