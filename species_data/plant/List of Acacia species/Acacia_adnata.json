    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia adnata is a shrub of the genus Acacia and the subgenus Plurinerves that is native to Western Australia.",
    "Description": "The erect shrub has green phyllodes that are 4 to 5 millimetres (0.157 to 0.197 in) long and 2 to 3 mm (0.079 to 0.118 in) wide. The terete and slightly hairy banchlets have persistent stipules with a length of 1 to 2.5 mm (0.039 to 0.098 in). The patent, oblong phyllodes have a subquadrate or oblong-elliptic shape that is asymmetric. The pungent rigid phyllodes are 4 to 5 mm (0.16 to 0.20 in) in length and have a width of 2 to 3 mm (0.079 to 0.118 in) with three to four distinct veins. The simple inflorescences are yellow and spherical and later form into straight linear brown seed pods with a width of around 4 mm (0.157 in) and a length of up to 5 cm (2.0 in). The rounded helmet shaped seeds within the pod are mottled and turgid and about 2.5 mm (0.098 in) long.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was first formally described by the botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1882 as part of the work Remarks on Australian Acacias as published in Australasian Chemist and Druggist. It was reclassified as Racosperma adnatum in 2003 then transferred back genus Acacia in 2006.",
    "Distribution": "It is endemic to a small area around the Irwin River in the Mid West region of Western Australia.",
