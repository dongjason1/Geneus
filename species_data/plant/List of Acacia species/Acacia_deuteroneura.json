    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia deuteroneura is a shrub belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Phyllodineae that is endemic to Queensland. It was listed as vulnerable according to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 in 2008.",
    "Description": "The shrub typically grows to a height of 3 m (9.8 ft) and has glabrous branchlets with a white frosted appearance. It has green phyllodes with a narrowly elliptic to oblanceolate shape and a length of 3 to 6 cm (1.2 to 2.4 in) and a width of 6 to 12 mm (0.24 to 0.47 in). When it blooms around August it produces spherical flower-heads containing 20 to 30 yellow flowers. The seed pods that form after flowering reach a length of up to 5 cm (2.0 in) and a width of 13 mm (0.51 in). The shiny black seeds within the pods are 3.5 to 4 mm (0.14 to 0.16 in) in length.",
    "Distribution": "It only has a limited distribution in the Great Dividing Range about 60 km (37 mi) north of Tambo where it grows on eroded sandstone hills as a part of Eucalyptus bakeri woodlands. in skeletal sandy soils. Only around 100 specimens were observed at the site in 1973.",
