    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia craspedocarpa, commonly known as hop mulga, is a tree in the family Fabaceae.  Endemic to Western Australia, it occurs in watercourses, on floodplains and alongside rivers throughout south-central Western Australia.\nHop mulga is a spreading, shrubby tree that can grow to three metres but it is usually smaller.  Like most Acacia species, it has phyllodes rather than true leaves.  These are bluish green, about two centimetres long and one centimetres wide.  The flowers are yellow, and held in cylindrical clusters up to two centimetres long and five millimetres in diameter.  The pods are broad and flat, and resemble the pods of the hop plant.",
