    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia gunnii, commonly known as ploughshare wattle or dog's tooth wattle, is a  shrub which is endemic to south-eastern Australia. It grows to up to 1 metre high and has prickly phyllodes which are 4 to 15 mm long. The cream to pale yellow  globular flowerheads appear singly in the axils of the phyllodes in June to October,  followed by curved or coiled seed pods which are 40 mm long and 4 to 5 mm wide.The species was first formally described by English botanist George Bentham in the London Journal of Botany in 1842. It occurs in South Australia, Victoria, Tasmania, New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory, and Queensland.\n\n\n== References =="
