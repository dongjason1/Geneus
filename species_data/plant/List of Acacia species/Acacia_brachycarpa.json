    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia brachycarpa is a shrub belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Phyllodineae endemic to Queensland.\nThe shrub has a mompact and much-branched habit that typically grows to a height of less than 2 m (6 ft 7 in). The sparsely to moderately hirsutellous branchlets have 1 mm (0.039 in) long stipules. The pungent, rigid, flat, linear to linear-triangular shaped phyllodes have a midrib on each face . The phyllodes have a length of 9 to 15 mm (0.35 to 0.59 in) and a width of around 1 mm (0.039 in). The simple inflorescences occur singly per axil. The small spherical flower-heads contain 8 to 18 bright lemon yellow flowers. The blackish glabrous seed pods that form after flowering have a length of 8 to 20 mm (0.31 to 0.79 in) and a width of 3 to 4 mm (0.12 to 0.16 in) and contain one to three oblong seeds.The species was first formally described by the botanist Leslie Pedley in 1969 as part of the work Notes on Acacia, chiefly from Queensland as published in Contributions from the Queensland Herbarium. It was reclassified as Racosperma brachycarpum by Pedley in 1987 then transferred back into the genus Acacia in 2001.The shrub has a disjunct distribution in south eastern Queensland between Stanthorpe in the south extending north as far as Blackdown Tableland National Park where it is found on rocky sandy sandstone soils as a part of open Eucalyptus woodland communities.",
