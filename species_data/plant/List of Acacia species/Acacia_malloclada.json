    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia malloclada is a shrub belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Juliflorae that is native to northern  Australia.\nThe shrub has a slender habit and has hairy and angular branchlets. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. It has stiff, linear, flat, straight to slightly curved evergreen phyllodes. They have a length of 3 to 5.5 cm (1.2 to 2.2 in) and a width of 2 to 4 mm (0.079 to 0.157 in) and have many stomates. The phyllodes are sparsely hairy and have six to ten parallel, longitudinal veins that are equally prominent.",
