The green linear to narrowly elliptic phyllodes are slightly curved and have a length of 4 to 10 cm (1.6 to 3.9 in) and a width 1 to 3.5 mm (0.039 to 0.138 in). The sparsely hairy to glabrous phyllodes have ciliate margins with three main longitudinal veins. The pale yellow globular flower-heads have a diameter of 3 to 6 mm (0.12 to 0.24 in) and contain 10 to 25 flowers and appear singly or in pairs in the leaf axils between July and October in the species' native range.
