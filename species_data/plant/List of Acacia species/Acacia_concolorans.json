    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia concolorans is a shrub belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Phyllodineae that is endemic to Western Australia.",
    "Description": "The intricate and pungent shrub typically grows to a height of 0.1 to 0.5 metres (0.3 to 1.6 ft). It has green and scabridulous branchlets with yellow ribs and 2 mm (0.079 in) long straight stipules. The pungent, green and oblong to narrowly oblong shaped phyllodes are flat and thick with a length of 4 to 10 mm (0.16 to 0.39 in) and a width of 1.5 to 2 mm (0.059 to 0.079 in). It blooms from July to August and produces yellow flowers. The rudimentary inflorescences occur in groups of two per raceme, the small spherical flower-heads contain seven to eight golden flowers. The narrowly oblong seed pods that form after flowering are curved and have a length of around 5 cm (2.0 in) and a width of 4 to 5 mm (0.16 to 0.20 in). the pods contain irregularly ovate-elliptic shiny dark brown seeds.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was first formally described by the botanist Bruce Maslin in 1999 as part of the work Acacia miscellany 16. The taxonomy of fifty-five species of Acacia, primarily Western Australian, in section Phyllodineae (Leguminosae: Mimosoideae) as published in the journal Nuytsia. It was reclassified as Racosperma concolorans by Leslie Pedley in 2003 and transferred back to the genus Acacia in 2006. It is closely related to Acacia inamabilis which has larger phyllodes and larger flower-heads containing many more flowers.",
    "Distribution": "It is native to an area of the Wheatbelt and the Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia between Kondinin and Yilgarn where it is found on lateritic flats and hills growing in red to brown loam-clay soils as a part of open Eucalyptus woodland or mallee shrubland communities.",
