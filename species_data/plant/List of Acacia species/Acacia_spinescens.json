The usually will have few or no leaves with sometimes remaining at the base of the plant. The leaves have a curved or hooked shape with a prominent mid-vein. It flowers between July and October producing a solitary flower-spike solitary with bright yellow, globular flower-heads. It will later form dark brown seed pods with a curving and often twisted linear shape. Each pod is around 30 millimetres (1.2 in) in length with a width of 3.5 mm (0.1 in). Pods contain hard, dark brown seeds with an ovoid shape. Each seed is around 3.5 mm (0.1 in) long and 2.5 mm (0.1 in) wide.",

In South Australia it is found in southern parts extending from the Great Victoria Desert in the west through to the border with Victoria in the east . It is also found on Kangaroo Island.
