    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia cowleana, Halls Creek wattle, is a northern Australian native shrub. It is a flowering plant with yellow flowers that only open in winter. Its origin is the Northern Australia's dry tropics. It belongs to the genus of Acacia.",
    "Appearance": "It is a small tree of height 1–7 metres (6–12 feet) with large grey phyllodes and yellow rod     \nflowers. Its bark is fibrous. The phyllodes are 80 to 200 mm long by 10–30 mm wide and curved.",
    "Growth": "The shrub grows in woodlands with spinifex at Beulah Station near Enngonia. Its growth is medium-fast. It easily grows from seed but has a short life span. It is a reliable shrub for temperate to arid climates in reasonably well drained soils. Though not generally considered to be endangered, the species is regarded as rare in New South Wales. It is not commonly cultivated, though it is reported to be grown in California.\n\n\n== References =="
