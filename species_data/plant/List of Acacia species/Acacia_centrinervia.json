    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia centrinervia, commonly known as hairy white wattle, is a shrub belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Phyllodineae that is native to parts of eastern Australia.",
    "Description": "The shrub has erect or bushy habit and typically grows to a height of 0.3 to 1 m (1 ft 0 in to 3 ft 3 in). It has hairy green, straight, narrowly elliptic to narrowly oblanceolate shaped phyllodes with a length of 1.5 to 2.5 cm (0.59 to 0.98 in) and a width of 2 to 3 mm (0.079 to 0.118 in) and has a prominent midrib.\nIt flowers in the springtime between August and November producing single inflorescences that are found in the axil of the phyllodes. The spherical flower-heads with a diameter of around 4 mm (0.16 in) contain 20 bright yellow flowers.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was first formally described by the botanists Joseph Maiden and William Blakely in 1927 as published in Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales. It was reclassified as Racosperma centrinervium by Leslie Pedley in 1987 then transferred back to the genus Acacia in 2006. It is very closely related to Acacia lineata.",
    "Distribution": "The shrub is found in two disjunct populations, one around Parkes in New South Wales and the other near the Queensland - New South Wales border.",
