    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia linarioides is a shrub belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Juliflorae that is native to north Australia.",
    "Description": "The shrub typically grows to a maximum height of 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in) and has a spreading and resinous habit. It has dark grey coloured bark that has a smooth texture and glabrous angular branchlets. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. It blooms between January and July producing golden flowers. The cylindrical flower-spikes are found singly in the axils and have a length of 2 to 4.5 cm (0.79 to 1.77 in) and are packed with golden coloured flowers. The curved and teisted seed pods that form after flowering are constricted between and raised over the seeds. The pods have a length of 3.5 to 10 cm (1.4 to 3.9 in) and a width of 1.5 to 3 mm (0.059 to 0.118 in) with longitudinally arranged seeds inside. The brown-black coloured seeds have a narrowly oblong-elliptic shape with a length of 2.3 to 2.8 mm (0.091 to 0.110 in) and have a closed areole.",
    "Distribution": "It is endemic to the top end of the Northern Territory and on a few of the islands in the Gulf of Carpentaria where it is found in crevices and on plateaux, alongside creeks and among rocks in thin sandy sandstone based soils.",
