The green linear lanceolate shaped phyllodes have a length of up to 14 cm (5.5 in) and a width of 5 mm (0.20 in). The glabrous and shiny phyllodes are narrowed towards the base and have a prominent central vein. It blooms between May and November producing yellow flowers.

The smooth, brown and linear shaped seed pods that form after flowering can be straight or curved and have a length of up to 12 cm (4.7 in) and a width of 5 mm (0.20 in). The hard, black seeds found within the pods have an ellipsoidal shape with a length of 7 mm (0.28 in) and a width of 4 mm (0.16 in).",
