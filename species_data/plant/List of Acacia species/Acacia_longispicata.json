    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia longispicata, commonly known as the slender flower wattle, is a species of Acacia native to eastern Australia.",
    "Description": "The erect single stemmed tree typically grows to a height of 10 metres (33 ft) in height. The bark is smooth toward the tree top and rough and fibrous at the base. It has stout angled branchlets that are tawny yellow to maroon in color. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The coriaceous, silvery-green phyllodesa have a very narrowly elliptic to elliptic shape and are flat and slightly sickle shaped. They have a length of 9 to 19 cm (3.5 to 7.5 in) and a width of 10 to 44 mm (0.39 to 1.73 in) and can be glabrous or slightly haired with three prominent main nerves. It blooms between June and September producing flower-spikes that are 6 to 12 cm (2.4 to 4.7 in) in length and packed with golden flowers.",
    "Distribution": "It is endemic area that are north of Mitchell and Theodore extending to around Mount Garnet in Queensland. It is often situated on hillsides and along road-sides growing in sandy red and often skeletal soils as part of Eucalyptus woodland communities.",
