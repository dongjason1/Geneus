    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia confusa is a perennial tree native to South-East Asia. Some common names for it are acacia petit feuille, small Philippine acacia, Formosa acacia (Taiwan acacia) and Formosan koa. It grows to a height of 15m. The tree has become very common in many tropical Pacific areas, including Hawaii, where the species is considered invasive.",
    "Uses": "The wood has a density of about 0.75 g/cm³. In Taiwan, its wood was used to make support beams for underground mines.  The wood is also converted to charcoal for family use. The plant is used in traditional medicine and is available from herbal medicine shops (草藥店) in Taiwan, but there has been no clinical study to support its effectiveness.  It is also frequently used as a durable flooring material.",
