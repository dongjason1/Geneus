    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia redolens, commonly known as the Bank Catclaw or the Desert Carpet, is a shrub of the genus Acacia and the subgenus Plurinerves. It is native to an area along the southern coast in the Great Southern and Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia.The spreading fragrant shrub typically grows to a height of 0.5 to 3 metres (2 to 10 ft). It blooms from August to October and produces yellow flowers.\nThe plant is considered an invasive weed in areas of California where it was used as a fast growing groundcover along freeways. It is particularly problematic in the San Gabriel Valley and Mission Valley.",
