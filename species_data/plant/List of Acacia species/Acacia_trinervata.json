    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia trinervata, (three-veined wattle), is a shrub belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Phyllodineae in the Fabaceae family.",
    "Description": "A. trinervata is an erect or spreading shrub  which grows to a height of 1.5 to 3 m. Its  branchlets are smooth and  angle towards the apices. The phyllodes are very narrowly elliptic to linear with a pointed sharp tip, and 1.5–5 cm  by 1–3 mm wide. The  2 or 3 longitudinal veins are prominent. There is an inconspicuous gland 0–3 mm above base and the  pulvinus  is less than 1 mm long.\nThe inflorescences are  simple, and occur singly in  phyllode axils on  peduncles about 10–20 mm long. There are 20 to 30 bright yellow flowers which are 5 to 7.5 mm in diameter. The pods show slight raising over the seeds and are  6–12 cm by 1–3 mm wide and are papery to thinly leathery, and sometimes minutely hairy. The  seeds are  longitudinal with the  funicle folded 3 or 4 times.",
    "Distribution": "It is endemic to New South Wales, and restricted to western Sydney and the lower Blue Mountains.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was first described in 1825 by Franz Sieber. and the specific epithet derives from the Latin for \"three veined\".",
