It is an evergreen shrub native to Victoria, the South West Slopes and Southern Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia.The Latin specific epithet pravissima means \"very crooked\".It grows to 5 m (16 ft), producing racemes of ball-shaped yellow flowers in winter and spring.\nIn temperate regions it is hardy only in mild or warm coastal climates, but must be given a sheltered spot in full sun with neutral or acid soil. Elsewhere it should be grown under glass. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.",
