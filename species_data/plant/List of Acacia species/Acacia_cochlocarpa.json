    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia cochlocarpa is a shrub belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Juliflorae. It is native to Western Australia.The sprawling shrub typically grows to a height of 0.3 to 0.7 metres (1.0 to 2.3 ft) but reach a height of 1.5 metres (5 ft) and produces yellow flowers. The branchlets are slightly flexuose with persistent stipules. It has erect, narrowly oblong-elliptic shaped and incurved phyllodes. The phyllodes are 2.5 to 7.5 centimetres (1.0 to 3.0 in) in length with a width of 3 to 6 millimetres (0.12 to 0.24 in). There are two simple inflorescences per axil. The flower heads are subglobular to short-cylindrical with a length of 5 to 10 mm (0.20 to 0.39 in) and a diameter of 5 to 6 mm (0.20 to 0.24 in). After flowering tightly spirally or irregularly coiled seed pods form containing glossy mottled  round to oblong seeds that are 1.5 to 2.5 mm (0.06 to 0.10 in).It has a scattered distribution in the Wheatbelt of Western Australia where it grows in sandy, clay gravelly soils often around laterite. Found in areas around Watheroo and Manmanning as a part of sandy heathland communities.There are two known subspecies:\n\nAcacia cochlocarpa Meisn. subsp. cochlocarpa\nAcacia cochlocarpa subsp. velutinosa Maslin & A.R.ChapmanA cochlocarpa is similar in appearance and closely related to Acacia lirellata and is also closely related to Acacia tetraneura.",
