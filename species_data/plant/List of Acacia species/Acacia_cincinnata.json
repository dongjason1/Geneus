    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia cincinnata, also known as the Daintree wattle or circle fruit salwood, is a species of leguminous trees of the plant family Fabaceae, found naturally in north eastern Australia.",
    "Description": "It is usually a small tree with a height of 5 to 25 m (16 to 82 ft) and has been recorded with a dbh of 60 cm (24 in). It has furrowed and flaky bark that is dark grey to black in colour. The stout and angular, lightly haired branchlets with a pale brownish grey colour. Like many species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The flat evergreen phyllodes have a falcate narrowly elliptic shape that tapers gradually towards apex and base. They are 10 to 16 cm (3.9 to 6.3 in) in length with a width of 11 to 30 mm (0.43 to 1.18 in) with three 3 main conspicuous nerves. The tree flowers between May and June, producing yellow inflorescences.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was first formally described by the botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1878 as part of the work Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae. It was reclassified as Racosperma cincinnatum in 1987 by Leslie Pedley then transferred back to genus Acacia in 2006.",
    "Distribution": "The tree is endemic to Queensland where it is often situated along the margins of rainforest in damper parts of the Atherton Tableland, the Eungella Range and the adjacent coast and in high rainfall areas between Maryborough and Brisbane. The tree is also found along river banks and in open Eucalyptus forest communities usually growing in sandy soils over granite.",
