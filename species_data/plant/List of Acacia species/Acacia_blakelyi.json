    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia blakelyi is a shrub or tree belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Phyllodineae. \nThe dense glabrous shrub or tree typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 metres (3 to 10 ft). The branchlets are flexuous with caducous stipules. The green phyllodes are horizontally flattened with a linear to very narrowly elliptic shape. Each phyllode is 7 to 15 centimetres (2.8 to 5.9 in) in length with a width of 2 to 15 millimetres (0.08 to 0.59 in) and are coarsely pungent. It blooms from July to September and produces yellow flowers. Inflorescences are made up of three to four globular heads each with a diameter of 7 to 8 mm (0.28 to 0.31 in) each composed of 20 to 30 golden flowers. Following flowering seed pods that are straight to shallowly curved up to about 16 cm (6.3 in) in length and 4 to 5 mm (0.16 to 0.20 in). The elliptic to narrowly elliptic shiny black seeds  within are 5.5 to 7 mm (0.22 to 0.28 in) long.It is native to an area in the Wheatbelt and the Mid West regions of Western Australia. It is found as far north as an area in between Denham and Kalbarri to around Piawaning in the south on sand plains and gentle rises where it grows in sandy lateritic soils. The shrub is usually part of the understorey in woodland or tall shrubland communities.",
