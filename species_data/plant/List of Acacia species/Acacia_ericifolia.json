    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia ericifolia is a shrub belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Phyllodineae endemic to Western Australia.",
    "Description": "The spreading shrub typically grows to a height of 0.2 to 1.2 metres (1 to 4 ft). The loosely villous branchlets have caducous, connate stipules that are around 2 mm (0.079 in) in length. The fleshy, green, linear to narrowly oblong shaped phyllodes are planoconvex to horizontally flattened with a length of 5 to 25 mm (0.20 to 0.98 in) and a width of 0.5 to 1.5 mm (0.020 to 0.059 in). It blooms from April to August and produces yellow flowers. The simple inflorescences are found singly or in pairs in the axils. The spherical flower-heads have a diameter of 3.5 to 4 mm (0.14 to 0.16 in) containing 18 to 33 golden flowers. The linear seed pods that form after flowering have a length of up to 2.5 cm (0.98 in) and a width of 1.5 mm (0.059 in) and contain oblong shaped seeds that are 2 to 2.5 mm (0.079 to 0.098 in).",
    "Distribution": "It is native to an area in the Mid West, Wheatbelt and Great Southern regions of Western Australia between Northampton in the north to Lake Grace in the south where it is found on sandplains and coastal cliffs, laterite hills and granite outcrops where it grows in skeletal sandy soils. It can be a part of heathland communities or in wandoo or marri woodland communities.",
