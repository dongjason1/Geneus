    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia neurophylla, also known as wodjil, is a shrub or tree belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Juliflorae that is endemic to south western Australia.",
    "Description": "The shrub or tree typically grows to a height of 0.5 to 5 metres (2 to 16 ft) and produces yellow flowers from May to November. It has an erect or low spreading habit with ribbed and glabrous branchlets. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The evergreen and erect phylodes have a narrowly oblong-elliptic shape and are straight to shallowly incurved. The phyllodes have a length of 4.5 to 18.5 cm (1.8 to 7.3 in) and a width of 3.5 to 13 mm (0.14 to 0.51 in) and can be coarsely to sharply pungent. The glabrous and rigid phyllodes have five to seven raised and equally prominent nerves.",
    "Distribution": "It is native to Wheatbelt, Mid West and Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia and the plant will grow in sandy, loamy or lateritic soils and is often found on plains, rises and granite outcrops. The range extends from approximately 100 km (62 mi) north of Kalbarri in the north west down to around 60 km (37 mi) south of Norseman in the south east.",
