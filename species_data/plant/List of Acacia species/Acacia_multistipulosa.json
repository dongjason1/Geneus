    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia multistipulosa is a shrub or tree belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Juliflorae that is native to northern Australia.",
    "Description": "The shrub or tree can grow to a maximum height of 10 m (33 ft) and usually has a spindly habit. It has dark brown to black to grey coloured bark that is smooth on younger trees but becomes longitudinally fissured as it ages. The plant has terete and densely haired branchlets with very conspicuous stipules. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The evergreen phyllodes have a narrowly elliptic to oblanceolate shape and can be slightly sickle-shaped. The coriaceous and often hairy phyllodes have a length of 3 to 10.5 cm (1.2 to 4.1 in) and a width of 4 to 8 mm (0.16 to 0.31 in) with one prominent midvein and 8 to 13 minor nerves per millimetre. It blooms between March and June producing golden flowers. The cylindrical flower-spikes are 2.4 to 9 cm (0.94 to 3.54 in) in length and densely packed with bright yellow flowers. The scurfy green aging to brown seed pods that form after flowering have a flat linear shape but can occasionally be slightly twisted and have a length of 3.5 to 8 cm (1.4 to 3.1 in) and a width of 5 to 7 mm (0.20 to 0.28 in). The dark-brown to black seeds inside are arranged obliquely and a 3.6 to 4 mm (0.14 to 0.16 in) in length with a pale open areole.",
    "Distribution": "It is endemic to the Northern Territory where it is confined to an area within Kakadu National Park where it is often situated on rocky ledges, usually amongst boulders growing in sandy soils over sandstone as a part of open Eucalyptus woodland communities with an understorey of Triodia.",
