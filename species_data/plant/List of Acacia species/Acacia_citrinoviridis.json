    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia citrinoviridis, commonly known as black mulga, river jam, milhan or wantan, is a tree  in the family Fabaceae.  Endemic to Western Australia, it occurs along creeks and rivers in the semi-arid land north of Carnarvon and Meekatharra.\nBlack mulga grows to a height of about 8 metres (26 ft).  It usually has just one trunk.  Like most Acacia species, it has phyllodes rather than true leaves.  These are a grey-olive colour, and may be up to 12 centimetres (4.7 in) long and about 1 centimetre (0.4 in) wide.  The flowers are yellow, and held in cylindrical clusters.  The pods are around 8 centimetres (3 in) long and have a lemon-green felty covering.  From a distance black mulga is similar to mulga but it can be distinguished by its dark bark.",
