    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia stenoptera, commonly known as narrow-winged wattle,  is a species of wattle that is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia.",
    "Description": "It is a rigid and prickly shrub that typically grows to a height of 0.2 to 0.7 metres (0.7 to 2.3 ft) but can reach as high as 2 m (7 ft). It can have a scrambling, sprawling or tangled erect habit. The shrub has ridged stems and curving spine-tipped phyllodes that form continuous wings along the stem.\nIt produces globular, cream or yellow flowerheads between March to December in the species' native range.\nAfter flowering it will produce quadrangular seed pods that are 3 to 7 centimetres (1.2 to 2.8 in) long with prominent ridges.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was first formally described by the botanist George Bentham in 1842 as part of William Jackson Hooker work Notes on Mimoseae, with a synopsis of species as published in the London Journal of Botany.\nThe species was reclassified as Racosperma stenopterum in 2003 by Leslie Pedley then transferred back to the genus Acacia in 2006.",
    "Distribution": "The shrub is found from the Mid West, Wheatbelt, Peel, South West and Great Southern regions of Western Australia where it is found in a variety of habitats growing in sandy soils often around laterite.",
