    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia fodinalis is a tree belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Juliflorae that is native to north eastern Australia.",
    "Description": "The tree typically grows to a maximum height of 10 m (33 ft). It has reddish coloured and sharply angular branchlets that are resinous when the tree is young. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The evergreen phyllodes are slightly sickle shaped and taper equally to each end. The glabrous are around 8.5 to 13 cm (3.3 to 5.1 in) in length and 8 to 15 mm (0.31 to 0.59 in) wide and have crowded and parallel longitudinal nerves parallel where two or three are more prominent than the others. When it blooms it produces simple inflorescences with a rather open cylindrical flower-spike that has a length of 25 to 70 mm (0.98 to 2.76 in) containing  yellow flowers. Following flowering linear shaped, brown cloured seed pods for that are raised over seeds and slightly constricted between them. The pods are straight with a length of around 45 mm (1.8 in) and a width of 2.3 to 3 mm (0.091 to 0.118 in) with yellow coloured marginal nerves. The light brown seeds within the pod are arranged longitudinally are around 3.5 mm (0.14 in) in length and 1.7 to 2 mm (0.067 to 0.079 in) wide with a yellow cupular aril.",
    "Distribution": "It is endemic to central eastern Queensland where it is found in the upper portion on the Isaac River watershed and adjacent parts of the Belyando River catchment where it usually situated on floodplains and riverbanks growing in sandy soils as a part of open Eucalyptus woodland communities and is mostly associated with Eucalyptus crebra.",
