    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia translucens, commonly known as poverty bush, is a shrub that grows on arid spinifex plains in northern Australia.  It is distributed throughout the inland Pilbara and Kimberley regions of Western Australia, and east into the Victoria River region of the Northern Territory.\nPoverty bush is a low, spreading shrub with a flat top.  It grows up to 1 metres high and 1.5 metres wide.  As with many arid shrubland Acacia species, it has phyllodes instead of leaves.  Its flowers are yellow, and held in spherical clusters about 5 millimetres in diameter.  The seed pods are held erect above the foliage, instead of hanging down like most Acacias.  The pods can be up to 9 centimetres long.",
