    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia ferocior is a shrub belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Phyllodineae that is endemic to an area along the south coast of Western Australia.\nThe spiny shrub typically grows to a height of 0.15 to 0.7 metres (0 to 2 ft) and a diameter of around 2 m (6 ft 7 in) and it can have a rigid semi-prostrate to erect compact or spreading habit. The green, short, straight, erect, spinescent, green branches can be glabrous or slightly hairy. The green linear to asymmetrically oblanceolate shaped phyllodes have a length of 5 to 13 mm (0.20 to 0.51 in) and width of 1 to 3 mm (0.039 to 0.118 in). It produces yellow flowers from August to October. The rudimentary inflorescences occur singly with spherical flower-heads have a diameter of 2.5 to 3 mm (0.098 to 0.118 in) and contain six to nine  golden to lemon yellow flowers. The seed pods that form after flowering are coiled with a length of about 1 cm (0.39 in) and a width of 3 mm (0.12 in) which contain shiny black seeds with an ovate shape.It is native to an area along the south coast in the Goldfields-Esperance and Great Southern regions of Western Australia extending from Albany in the south west to Tambellup in the north west through to Ravensthorpe in the east where it grows in sandy-loam to clay soils as a part of mallee scrubland communities.",
