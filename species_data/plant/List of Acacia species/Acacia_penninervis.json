    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia penninervis, commonly known as mountain hickory wattle, or blackwood, is a perennial shrub or tree 2–8m high, which is native to Australia.\nIts uses include environmental management. The tannin content of the bark is approximately 18%.It occurs in the Australian states of Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria, and as an introduced species on New Zealand's North Island and South Island. The variety A. p. var. penninervis occurs in the same Australian states of Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria. The variety A. p. var. longiracemosa occurs in coastal districts of southern Queensland, and northern New South Wales.The 1889 book 'The Useful Native Plants of Australia’ records that common names included \"Hickory\" and \"Blackwood\" and that \"The bark (and, according to some, the leaves) of this tree was formerly used by the aboriginals [sic.] of southern New South Wales for catching fish. They would throw them into a waterhole, when the fish would rise to the top and be easily caught. Neither the leaves nor bark contain strictly poisonous substances, but, like the other species of Acacia, they would be deleterious, owing to their astringency.\"",
