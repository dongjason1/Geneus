    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia sericophylla is a shrub or tree commonly known as the desert dogwood, desert oak or cork-bark wattle. To the Indigenous Australian people of the area, the Nyangumarta peoples, it is known as Pirrkala. The species is of the genus Acacia and the subgenus Plurinerves. It is native to an area in the Northern Territory and the Kimberley and Pilbara regions of Western Australia. It is also found in New South Wales and South Australia.The gnarled shrub or tree typically grows to a height of 12 metres (39 ft). It has thick spongy grey bark that fissures longitudinally.",
    "Taxonomy": "In 1859 Ferdinand von Mueller described this species, and named it Acacia sericophylla. In 1993, Richard Cowan and Bruce Maslin assigned it to the subspecies, Acacia coriacea subsp. sericophylla. However, the Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria via the Australian Plant Census currently (2006) recognises the plant as Acacia sericophylla.",
    "Etymology": "The species epithet, sericophylla, derives from the Greek words, sericos (silken) and phyllon (leaf), and refers to the dense silky hairs found particularly on the young phyllodes.",
