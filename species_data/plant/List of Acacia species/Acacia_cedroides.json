It has finely ribbed and striated hairy branchlets with linear-triangular stipules that are 1.5 to 4 mm (0.059 to 0.157 in) in length. The rigid, green, inclined to ascending phyllodes are often shallowly incurved with a length of 1 to 4 mm (0.039 to 0.157 in) and a width of 0.8 to 1.3 mm (0.031 to 0.051 in). It blooms from August to November and produces cream-yellow flowers. The simple inflorescences has spherical flower-heads that contain 15 to 25 cream to pale yellow coloured flowers. The curved red to brown coloured seed pods that form after flowering have a length of {cvt|5|cm}} and a width of 2.5 to 3.5 mm (0.098 to 0.138 in). The oblong grey-brown seeds within the pods have a length of 4 to 5 mm (0.16 to 0.20 in).It is native to an area along the south coast in the Great Southern and the Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia between Jerramungup and Ravensthorpe where it is found on rocky hillsides growing in shallow stony soils with most of the population found in the Fitzgerald River National Park.",
