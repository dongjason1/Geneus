    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia microneura is a shrub belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Juliflorae endemic to southern Western Australia.",
    "Description": "The slender shrub typically grows to a height of 1.5 metres (5 ft). The resinous and angled branchlets have small white hairs between the angles. The ascending, linear, straight to slightly curved green phyllodes have a length of 4 to 11 cm (1.6 to 4.3 in) and a width of 1 to 2 mm (0.039 to 0.079 in). The phyllodes have a central nerve and broader marginal nerves. It flowers from August to October producing yellow flowers. The simple inflorescences occur singly or in pairs per node. The spherical to obloid flower-heads have a diameter of around 5.5 mm (0.22 in) and contains 20 flowers.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was first formally described by the botanist Carl Meissner as part of Johann Georg Christian Lehmann's work Leguminosae. Plantae Preissianae. It was reclassified as Racosperma microneurum by Leslie Pedley in 2003 then transferred back to the genus Acacia in 2006. The only other synonym is Acacia subangularis, but the plant is also often confused with Acacia lineolata.",
    "Distribution": "It is native to a small area in the Great Southern region of Western Australia around the town of Cranbrook where it is found in disturbed areas and heathlands where it grows in sandy-loamy soils over and around granite.",
