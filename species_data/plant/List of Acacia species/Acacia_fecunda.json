    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia fecunda, commonly known as Mosquito Creek wattle, is a shrub belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Juliflorae that is endemic to north western Australia.",
    "Description": "The erect, obconic shrub typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 3 metres (5 to 10 ft) with grey bark on the trunk that lightens to yellow brown on upper branches. It usually has two to four main stems with a diamter of 4 to 5 cm (1.6 to 2.0 in) at the base. The crown is open and spreads to a width of around 3 m (9.8 ft). It has terete and slender branchlets that are finely ribbed and densely covered in fine what hairs. Like msot species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The dull, green to blue-green coloured phyllodes have a narrowly elliptic to oblanceolate shape and can be straight or shallowly sickly shaped with a length of 8 to 12 cm (3.1 to 4.7 in) and a width of 10 to 15 mm (0.39 to 0.59 in). The glabrous or slightly hairy phyllodes are coriaceous and often slightly resinous with fine parallel longitudinal nerves. The plant blooms between May and August producing yellow flowers.",
    "Distribution": "It is native to an area in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. It is has only a few disjunct populations that are situated  near where the Oakover River and Davis River meet to the east of Nullagine in rocky areas composed of Mosquito Creek sedimentary rocks.",
