    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia ausfeldii, commonly known as Ausfeld's wattle or whipstick cinnamon wattle, is a shrub species that is endemic to south-eastern Australia. It grows to between 1 and 4 metres high and has phyllodes that are 2 to 7 cm long and 2 to 6 mm wide. The yellow globular flowerheads appear in groups of two or three in the axils of the phyllodes in August to October, followed by straight seed pods which are 4 to 9 cm long and 2 to 4 mm wide.The species was first formally described in 1867 by German botanist Eduard August von Regel based on a horticultural specimen grown from seed collected by J.G. Ausfeld in Bendigo, Victoria.Plants thought to be hybrids between this species and Acacia paradoxa have been recorded in Victoria.\n\n\n== References =="
