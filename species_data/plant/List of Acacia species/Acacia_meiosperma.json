    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia meiosperma is a shrub or tree belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Juliflorae that is native to north eastern Australia.",
    "Description": "The shrub or tree typically grows to a maximum height of 2 to 3 m (6 ft 7 in to 9 ft 10 in) and has glabrous and angular, resinous branchlets. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The usually glabrous phyllodes have an inequilaterally narrowly elliptic shape and are straight to slightly recurved with a length of 7 to 12.5 cm (2.8 to 4.9 in) and a width of 2 to 3 cm (0.79 to 1.18 in) and have three to five prominent veins and many fine, close and nonanastomosing veins. The inflorescences are found in groups of one to four in the axils, with 1.5 to 3.5 cm (0.59 to 1.38 in) long flower-spikes packed with golden coloured flowers. The glabrous and coriaceous seed pods that form after flowering have a compressed-linear shape with a length of up to 8 cm (3.1 in) and a width of around 3 mm (0.12 in) and are obscurely longitudinally ribbed. The glossy bark brown seeds have a yellow centre and an oblong shape with a length of 3 to 4 mm (0.12 to 0.16 in) and a creamy white folded aril.",
    "Distribution": "It is endemic to a small restricted area in Queensland located about 40 km (25 mi) south east of Chillagoe where it is found in pure stands growing on plains and slopes in shallow stony soils.",
