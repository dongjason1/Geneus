The thin, evergreen phyllodes have a narrowly elliptic shape that can be shallowly recurved. The phyllodes have a length of 7 to 10 cm (2.8 to 3.9 in) and 7 to 10 mm (0.28 to 0.39 in) that dry to a light brown. It blooms in May or October and produces yellow flowers.",

It was reclassified as Racosperma lentigineum by Leslie Pedley in 2003 and was transferred back to genus Acacia in 2006.\nThe type specimen was collected by Charles Austin Gardner in 1921.",
