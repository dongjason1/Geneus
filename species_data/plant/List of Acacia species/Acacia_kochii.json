    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia kochii is a shrub belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Phyllodineae.",
    "Description": "The spreading, spiny and intricate shrub typically grows to a height of 0.5 to 2 metres (1.6 to 6.6 ft). It has glabrous branches with 0.5 to 2 cm (0.20 to 0.79 in) long thorns. It has clusters of phyllodes found in the nodes. The phyllodes have an asymmetrically narrowly oblong-elliptic to narrowly oblanceolate shape with a length of 1 to 2 cm (0.39 to 0.79 in) and a width of 2 to 7 mm (0.079 to 0.276 in). It produces yellow flowers in August. The simple inflorescences occur singly or in groups of two or three. The flower-heads are shortly cylindrical or have an obloid shape with a length of 7 to 15 mm (0.28 to 0.59 in) and a diameter of 5 to 6 mm (0.20 to 0.24 in) with golden flowers. The seed pods that form after flowering resemble a sting of beads with a length of up to 9 cm (3.5 in) and a width of 5 mm (0.20 in). The dull black seeds in the pods have an elliptic shape.",
    "Distribution": "It is native to an area in the Wheatbelt and Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia between Yalgoo in the north to Moora in the south growing in clay or loamy-sandy soils.",
