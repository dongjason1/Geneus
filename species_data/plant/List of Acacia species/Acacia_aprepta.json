    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia aprepta is a species of Acacia native to eastern Australia.The tree can grow to a height of 10 m (33 ft) and has a spreading habit. It dark grey or black coloured bark that is longitudinally furrowed. The light brown to greyish, glabrous and resinous branchlets are angular to terete. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The linear or very narrowly oblanceolate and flat phyylodes can be straight or slightly subfalcate. The scrurfy olive-green phyllodes are 3.5 to 8.5 cm (1.4 to 3.3 in) in length and 3 to 8 mm (0.12 to 0.31 in) and have one to three prominent longitudinal veins. It bloooms between October and January producing flower-spikes that occur in groups of one to three in the axils and are 0.6 to 3.5 cm (0.24 to 1.38 in) in length. After flowering light brown chartaceous seed pods form that have a linear or very narrowly oblong shape and are raised over the seeds. The pods are 2.5 to 6 cm (0.98 to 2.36 in) in length and 5 to 9 mm (0.20 to 0.35 in) wide. The dark brown seeds within have a broadly oblong shape and are 2.3 to 3.5 mm (0.091 to 0.138 in) long.It has a limited distribution in an area of south-eastern Queensland in the western parts of the Darling Downs and around Maranoa where it grows in shallow gravelly or loamy sandy soils often over sandstone as a part of scrubland communities where it can form dense thickets.",
