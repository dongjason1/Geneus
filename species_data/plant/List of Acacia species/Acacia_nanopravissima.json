    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia nanopravissima, also known as little kooka wattle, is a shrub belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Phyllodineae where it is endemic to south eastern Australia.",
    "Description": "The shrub typically grows to a height of 0.5 to 0.9 m (1 ft 8 in to 2 ft 11 in) but can reach as high as 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in) and has glabrous branchlets. The crowded green phyllodes have a markedly inequilateral shape with a length of 4 to 8 mm (0.16 to 0.31 in) and a width of 3 to 8 mm (0.12 to 0.31 in). When it blooms between late August and early October, it produces racemose inflorescences with spherical flower-heads that contain seven to nine golden coloured flowers.",
    "Distribution": "It is native to a small area in north eastern Victoria around Splitters Creek as a part of open forest communities growing in shallow sediment based soils. It is confined to a small area to the south of Wulgulmerang in East Gippsland and is only found as a single small population in the upper catchment of Little River, a tributary of the Snowy River on the Wombargo Range.",
