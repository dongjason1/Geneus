Miscellaneous new taxa and lectotypifications in Western Australian Acacia, mostly section Plurinerves (Leguminosae: Mimosoideae) as published in the journal Nuytsia.\nThe only known synonym is Racosperma auratiflorum as classified by Leslie Pedley in 2003.The type specimen was collected by Mary Tindale in 1973 about 35 kilometres (22 mi) east of Lake Grace.",
