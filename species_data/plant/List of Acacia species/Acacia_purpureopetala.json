    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia purpureopetala, more commonly known as Cupid's wattle, is the only pink flowering wattle in Australia. It grows in the Herberton district of north-east Queensland.  Under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity and Conservation Act 1999 it is listed as critically endangered. It is only known from five discreet locations with less than 1000 individual plants remaining.\nCommunity members often refer to the plant as Cupid's wattle or pink wattle because of the colour of the bloom, which comes around Mother's day every year.\n\n\n== References =="
