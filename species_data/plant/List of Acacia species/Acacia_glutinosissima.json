    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia glutinosissima is a shrub belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Phyllodineae that is endemic to western Australia.",
    "Description": "The spindly. open, sparingly branched and viscid shrub typically grows to a height of 1.8 to 3.0 metres (6 to 10 ft). The branchlets have a rough texture formed by stem-projections where phyllodes were once attached. Caducous stipules that are linear and have a length of 2 to 5 mm (0.079 to 0.197 in) also cover the branchlets. It has ascending to erect green to yellowish green phyllodes that are linear to shallowly incurved. Phyllodes are 9 to 17 cm (3.5 to 6.7 in) in length and 2 to 3.5 mm (0.079 to 0.138 in) wide. It produces yellow flowers from July to September. The spherical flower-heads contained 40 to 55 densely pack golden flowers. The linear seed pods that form after flowering have a length of up to 10 cm (3.9 in) and a width of 3.5 to 4.5 mm (0.14 to 0.18 in) containing oblong to elliptic shaped seeds with a length of 4 to 4.5 mm (0.16 to 0.18 in).",
    "Distribution": "It is native to an area in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia where it is found on rises and on sandplains growing in gravelly, sandy and lateritic soils. It has a scattered distribution from around Wubin in the north to around Bruce Rock in the south growing in open scrub.",
