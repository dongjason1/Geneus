    "Description": "The slender tree or spindly shrub typically grows to a height of less than 6 m (20 ft). It has terete red to brown branchlets that are glabrous and pruinose.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was first formally described by the botanist Joseph Maiden as Acacia bancroftii in 1918 as part of the work Proceedings of the Royal Society of Queensland. It was reclassified as Racosperma bancroftii in 1987 by Leslie Pedley then transferred back to the genus Acacia in 2006. The specific epithet honours Joseph Bancroft and his son, Thomas Lane Bancroft.",
