    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia camptoclada is a shrub belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Phyllodineae endemic to arid parts of Western Australia. \nThe low spreading to erect shrub typically grows to a height of 0.2 to 1.0 metre (1 to 3 ft). It has slightly sticky and polished branchlets with easily detached stipules. The crowded, ascending to erect glaucous green phyllodes have an asymmetrical oblanceolate to narrowly oblong shape. It blooms from August to October and produces yellow flowers. The inflorescences occur in groups of two to five and have showy spherical heads containing 15 to 21 golden flowers. The seed pods that form after flowering are coiled with a width of 4 to 5 mm (0.16 to 0.20 in) and contain ovate to elliptic shaped shiny black seeds with a length of around 3 mm (0.12 in).The shrub belongs to the Acacia prainii group and is closely related to Acacia dorsenna and Acacia prainii.It is native to an area in the eastern Wheatbelt and Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia where it is found in low-lying areas, on sandplains and dunes growing in sandy or clay soils. The range extends from Newdegate in the west to around Balladonia in the east and is often part of mallee or Eucalyptus woodland communities.",
