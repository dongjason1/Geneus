    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia gloeotricha is a shrub belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Juliflorae that is endemic to north western Australia.",
    "Description": "The open viscid shrub typically grows to a height of 4 metres (13 ft) and has finely ribbed hairy branchlets with persistent stipules. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The erect grey-green coloured phyllodes have a narrowly elliptic shape that is asymmetric with a length of 5 to 9 cm (2.0 to 3.5 in) and a width of 8 to 18 mm (0.31 to 0.71 in). It blooms in June producing yellow flowers. The simple inflorescences occur in pairs in the axils and have cylindrical shaped flower-spikes that are about 4 cm (1.6 in) in length with bright-golden flowers. The brown custaceous seed pods that form after flowering have a linear shape and are raised over the seeds. The pods have a width of 3 to 5 mm (0.12 to 0.20 in) with thick pale-coloured margins. The shiny black seeds are arranged longitudinally in the pods and have a broadly elliptic shape with a length of around 4.5 mm (0.18 in) and a white aril.",
    "Distribution": "It is native to an area in the Kimberley region of Western Australia where it has a limited range within the King Leopold Range where it grows in sandy soils over a sandstone substrate.",
