    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia nodiflora is a shrub belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Phyllodineae that is endemic to western Australia.",
    "Description": "The harsh, diffuse and intricate shrub typically grows to a height of 0.6 to 2 metres (2.0 to 6.6 ft). The terminal branchlets are sometimes coarsely spiny with 4 mm (0.16 in) long stipules. The phyllodes occur in clusters of up seven. The phyllodes have a linear to linear-oblanceolate shape with a length of 7 to 13 mm (0.28 to 0.51 in) and a width of 0.5 to 1.5 mm (0.020 to 0.059 in). It blooms from August to September and produces yellow flowers. The simple inflorescences occur singly or in groups of up to three per axil. The spherical to obloid flower-heads globular contain 25 to 55 golden flowers. The yellow-brown seed pods that form after flowering have a narrowly oblong shape and have a length of 6.5 cm (2.6 in) and a width of 7 to 8 mm (0.28 to 0.31 in). The dull brown seeds within the pods have an oblong shape and a length of around 5 mm (0.20 in).",
    "Distribution": "It is native to a small area in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia where it is found on rocky hills and granite ranges growing on rocky loam or clay soils. The bulk of the population is found around Carnamah and Morawa where it is found on rocky hills.",
