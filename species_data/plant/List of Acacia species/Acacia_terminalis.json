It's an Australian native whose range extends through New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania.\nFour subspecies have been recognised, although there are additional hybrids, especially around Sydney:\n\nA. terminalis subsp. angustifolia\nA. terminalis subsp. aurea\nA. terminalis subsp. longiaxialis\nA. terminalis subsp. terminalis: listed as an Endangered Species under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.
