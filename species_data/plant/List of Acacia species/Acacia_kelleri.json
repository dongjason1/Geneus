The light to dark brown branchlets are terete and woolly. The crowded and erect phyllodes  have a linear to narrowly lanceolate shape. the phyllodes are straight to slightly curved and 1 to 2.5 centimetres (0.39 to 0.98 in) in length with a width of 0.7 to 2.5 millimetres (0.028 to 0.098 in).\nIt blooms from March to October producing yellow flowers. The densely covered flower spikes are 1.3 to 4.5 cm (0.51 to 1.77 in) in length. Following flowering red brown seed pods for that are up to 11 cm (4 in) in length and 4.5 to 6 mm (0.177 to 0.236 in) long.",

The species was reclassified as Racosperma kelleri in 2003 by Leslie Pedley then transferred back to the genus Acacia in 2006.The type specimen was collected by Joseph Bradshaw in 1891 near Prince Regent River.",
