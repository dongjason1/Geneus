    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia excentrica is a shrub belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Phyllodineae native to Western Australia.",
    "Description": "The prostrate, domed or spreading prickly shrub typically grows to a height of 0.1 to 0.5 metres (0 to 2 ft). The stipules are 1 to 2 mm (0.039 to 0.079 in) in length. It has green phyllodes with a narrowly elliptic to oblong-elliptic and sometimes lanceolate shape. Each slightly asymmetric phyllode is 1 to 2 cm (0.39 to 0.79 in) in length and 2 to 5 mm (0.079 to 0.197 in) wide and is sharply pungent. It produces yellow flowers from July to October. Each simple inflorescence has one or two headed racemes with a length of 0.5 to 1 mm (0.020 to 0.039 in). The spherical flower heads have a diameter of 4 to 4.5 mm (0.16 to 0.18 in) and contain 20 to 30 golden yellow flowers. Seed pods form later that are linear with one or two coils.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was first formally described by the botanists Joseph Maiden and William Blakely in 1928 as part of the work Descriptions of fifty new species and six varieties of western and northern Australian Acacias, and notes on four other species as published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia. In 2003 it was reclassified as Racosperma excentricum by Leslie Pedley but transferred back into the genus Acacia in 2006.",
    "Distribution": "It has a scattered and disjunct distribution to an area in the Goldfields-Esperance, Wheatbelt and Great Southern regions of Western Australia between Albany in the west, Kondinin in the north and Cocklebiddy in the east. It is found on the plains where it grows in loamy or sandy clay soils over limestone.",
