    "Description": "The shrub typically grows to a height of 4 m (13 ft) with glabrous slender branchlets that have a dark red colour. The thin green straight to incurved phyllodes have a narrowly linear shape. The phyllodes have a length of 5 to 14 cm (2.0 to 5.5 in) and a width of 2 to 3 mm (0.079 to 0.118 in) with an obscure midrib.",

It was reclassified as Racosperma betchei in 1987 by Leslie Pedley then transferred back to the genus Acacia in 2001. It is often confused with Acacia adunca.",
    "Distribution": "It is found along the tablelands of the Great Dividing Range from north-eastern New South Wales from around Torrington in the south extending to south eastern Queensland to around Dalveen in the north. It is found in sandy granite based soils as a part of forest communities.",
