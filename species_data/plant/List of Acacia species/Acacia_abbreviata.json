    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia abbreviata is a shrub belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Juliflorae. It is endemic to arid parts of northern Australia\nThe resinous shrub has a spreading habit and typically grows to a height of 0.3 to 0.6 m (1 ft 0 in to 2 ft 0 in) with a width of 1 to 3.6 m (3 ft 3 in to 11 ft 10 in). The generally smooth pale grey-brown coloured bark is minutely fissured. The angular yellow to red-brown branchlets have small resinous hairs and obscure ridges. The linear green phyllodes occur in groups of six at the nodes. They have a narrowly oblong or narrowly oblanceolate shape and a length of 0.4 to 2.5 cm (0.16 to 0.98 in) and a width of 0.6 to 1.2 mm (0.024 to 0.047 in) with indistinct nerves. It blooms between April and October producing yellow flowers.The shrub is found in a small area of the Tanami Desert in the Northern Territory close to the Western Australian border. It is usually situated on stony lateritic ridges and plains where it grows in shallow clay loamy soils as a part of spinifex communities.",
