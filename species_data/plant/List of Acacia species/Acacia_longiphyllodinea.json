It has an open and wiry habit wit numerous glabrous stems. More mature specimens have dark grey bark that is fissured at the base. The brown branchlets are covered in white powdery substance and are slightly flattened towards the apices. The linear, green and rigidly erect phyllodes are 15 to 45 cm (5.9 to 17.7 in) in length and 1 to 1.5 mm (0.039 to 0.059 in) in diameter. It flowers from July to September producing yellow flowers.It is native to the Mid West and Wheatbelt regions of Western Australia where it is found on undulating plains and among granite outcrops growing in sandy or loamy gravel soils. It occupies an area from around Geraldton in the north to Yalgoo in the east and south to around Bencubbin and is usually associated with low Eucalyptus woodland communities.",
