    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia boormanii (common name : Snowy River wattle) is a medium, (sometimes) suckering, multi-stemmed, copse-forming shrub, belonging to the genus Acacia.\nIts native range is the Snowy River in the alpine country of south eastern Australia. It thrives best on well drained soils, but also tolerates compacted clay soils or soils with some salinity.\nThis evergreen, frost-hardy, rounded shrub grows to a height of 4.50 m (15 feet), and a diameter of 1.80 to 3.60 m (6 – 12 feet). Its  silvery branches carry small, gray-green leaves. The narrow phyllodes are about 8 cm long.\nIts inflorescence consists of lemon-yellow, globular flower heads, profusely borne in panicles, lasting four to six weeks.\nThis wattle is very popular in cultivation.\n\n\n== References =="
