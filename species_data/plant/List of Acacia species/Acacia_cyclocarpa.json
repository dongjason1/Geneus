    "__SUMMARY__": "Acacia cyclocarpa, commonly known as ring-pod minni-ritchie, is a shrub belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Juliflorae. It is native to a small area of the Kimberley region of Western Australia.",
    "Description": "The shrub has a sprawling, decumbent to semi-erect habit and typically grows to a height of 0.6 to 1 m (2 ft 0 in to 3 ft 3 in) and has minni ritchi style bark that is found at the at base of mature stems. The glabrous branchlets have persistent triangular shaped stipules that are around 1 mm (0.039 in) in length. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The evergreen, thin-textured and flat phyllodes have a narrowly linear to linear-elliptic shape that is narrowed at the base. The phyllodes have a length of 4 to 8.5 cm (1.6 to 3.3 in) in length and 1 to 2.5 mm (0.039 to 0.098 in) wide with a fine, curved, innocuous point.",
    "Distribution": "It is endemic to the north western parts of Western Australia in the Kimberley region where it is found in the Prince Regent River catchment area with reasonably large populations with the individuals growing in skeletal sandy soils over broken sandstone scattered over several kilometres. It is part of scrubland communities that also include Acacia orthocarpa, Eucalyptus miniata, Eucalyptus phoenicea, Owenia vernicosa and Triodia claytonii.",
