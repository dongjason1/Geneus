The phyllodes are flat and linear with a length of 3 to 8 millimetres (0.12 to 0.31 in) and 0.5 to 1 mm (0.020 to 0.039 in) wide and narrow toward the base. It blooms from August to October and produces yellow flowers. The simple inflorescences have globular heads globular with a diameter of 3 to 3.5 mm (0.118 to 0.138 in)composed of 18 to 27 flowers.
