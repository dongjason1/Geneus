    "__SUMMARY__": "Geranium × magnificum, the purple cranesbill, is a species of hardy flowering herbaceous perennial plant in the genus Geranium, family Geraniaceae. The multiplication symbol × indicates that it is the result of hybridisation, in this case between Geranium platypetalum and Geranium ibericum. Growing into a clump 70 cm (28 in) high and broad, it has the decorative, deeply-lobed leaves typical of the genus Geranium. Violet-blue flowers with darker veins are borne relatively briefly in early summer. Extremely hardy, to below −20 °C (−4 °F), it is suitable for cultivation throughout all temperate regions. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\n\n== References =="
