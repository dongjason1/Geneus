This Geranium species is native to the eastern half of Australia as well as New Zealand and Indonesia. G. potentilloides is commonly found in woodlands, grasslands and moist forested areas.  In Tasmania, Australia it is also found on eastern and central mountains up to 1000m.\nCharacteristic features of this plant include dark green leaves with a glossy adaxial surface and purple abaxial surface. These leaves are circular with deeply divided lobes. Their basal leaves are decidous.\nThe stem of this species can be used as a distinguishing feature as it has reflexed hairs that are pressed towards the stem. The plant also consists of a thick taproot system.\nBeing an angiosperm, their single flowers that appear in late summer to spring, are pale pink consisting of 5 rounded petals that are terminal on the axillary stem.\nThis plant is inconspicuous, requires well drained moist soil and can tolerate being shaded. It is also able to form roots at nodes that come in contact with soil.",
