    "__SUMMARY__": "Viola wikipedia is a species of flowering plant, in the genus Viola, and was named in 2019 after the online encyclopedia Wikipedia by the husband-and-wife team of botanists John Michael Watson and Ana Rosa Flores.Watson wrote:\none [resource] is particularly outstanding in that we consult it constantly for information on a wide variety of subjects related to our work – Wikipedia, as cited herein for example. The best token return we can think of is to name a plant accordingly, so it therefore gives us pleasure to record our gratitude via the replacement epithet of this species, as a noun in apposition.\n\nThe species is endemic to the Santiago region of Chile. It is known only from a specimen collected in January 1855, which was described by Rodolfo Amando Philippi in 1857 with the illegitimate homonym of Viola angustifolia.It is closely related to V. acanthophylla, V. bustillosia, and V. cheeseana, the latter being newly described in the same paper. It is differentiated from these other species by having \"Leaf margin shallowly long-serrate. Peduncle clearly shorter than leaves.\"However, according to International Plant Name Index, Viola wikipedia would be not a new species but a superfluous and illegitimate name of Viola angustifolia.\n\n\n== References =="
