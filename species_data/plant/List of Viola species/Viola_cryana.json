    "__SUMMARY__": "Viola cryana, the Cry violet, also known as Cry pansy, is an extinct plant species from the violet genus Viola which was endemic to the French Department Yonne. Vioala cryana was discovered in 1860 but first described in 1878.",
    "Description": "This biennial or perennial herb was not higher than 12 cm and had a glabrous stem. The light green leaves were thick and fleshy. The stipule was cut and had an entire central lobe. The relatively large flowers were zygomorphic. The petals were light violet. The spur was with six to seven millimetres larger than the calyx. The flowering period was from May to June.",
    "Extinction": "The Cry violet occurred in strongly restricted limestone outcrops in the region of Cry southeast of Tonnerre in the French department Yonne. Due to the habitat destruction because of the limestone quarrying and due to overexploitation by plant collectors it was thought to be extinct in the wild by 1930. This plant might have survived in cultivation until 1950.",
