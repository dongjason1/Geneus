    "__SUMMARY__": "Viola lutea, also known as the mountain pansy, is a species of violet that grows in Europe, from the British Isles to the Balkans.",
    "Description": "Viola lutea grows to a height of around 20 centimetres (8 in). Its flowers are 20–35 mm (0.8–1.4 in) in diameter, and are typically yellow, although some individuals may have blue, purple or blotched flowers instead.",
    "Taxonomy": "Viola lutea was first described by William Hudson in his 1762 Flora Anglica.",
    "Distribution": "Viola lutea subsp. lutea is native to central and north-western Europe, from the British Isles to Austria; another subspecies occurs further east, from Hungary to the Balkans. Within Great Britain, V. lutea is found only in upland areas north of a line drawn between the Severn and Humber estuaries; it ranges in altitude from 200 metres (660 ft) in Derbyshire to 1,070 m (3,500 ft) in Breadalbane. In Ireland, its distribution is more scattered geographically, and ranges vertically from sea level in County Clare to 380 m (1,250 ft) in the Wicklow Mountains.",
