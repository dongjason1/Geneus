    "__SUMMARY__": "Viola labradorica, commonly known as alpine violet, American dog violet, dog violet, and Labrador violet, is a perennial. It is native to Greenland, eastern Canada, and the eastern United States. The plant sold as Viola labradorica by nurseries is Viola riviniana.",
    "Uses": "",
    "Uses-Culinary": "Viola labradorica has edible leaves and flowers. The leaves are sometimes characterized as \"wooly\" and thus not as desirable for eating.",
    "Similar species": "A purple-leaved form of the European dog-violet (Viola riviniana 'Purpurea Group'), is often sold by nurseries as Viola labradorica. The true Viola labradorica is almost never sold.Viola riviana is grown as a flowering groundcover in gardens and as a house plant. It can become naturalized, or even an invasive species, when planted near adjacent native plant habitats and natural-wildland ecosystems.",
