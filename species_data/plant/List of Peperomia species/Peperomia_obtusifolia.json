The specific epithet obtusifolia means \"blunt-leaved\". The plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.",
    "Description": "It is an evergreen perennial growing to 25 cm (10 in) tall and broad, with cupped leathery leaves and narrow spikes of white flowers up to 12 cm (5 in) long, which grow in a shiny, winding manner and constitute the main decorative value of this plant.",
    "Cultivation": "With a minimum temperature of 15 °C (59 °F), it must be grown indoors in most temperate regions. Although it needs high humidity, it does not require much care, it is enough with good lighting (without becoming excessive) to maintain the bright and intense colour of the leaves, these together with the stem are fleshy, so they do not need a very abundant or frequent watering. Direct light causes discoloration of its leaves, its average lighting is enough. A popular houseplant, numerous cultivars have been developed, some of which show leaf variegation. In summer, it should be fertilised with liquid fertiliser every fortnight.",
    "Pests and diseases": "In general, it is a resistant plant, although it can have problems with aphids and mealybugs. Furthermore, excessive watering can cause root rot.",
