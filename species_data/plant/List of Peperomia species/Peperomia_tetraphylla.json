    "__SUMMARY__": "Peperomia tetraphylla, known as the acorn peperomia or four-leaved peperomia, is a small plant in the pepper family that grows in Australia, Asia, Africa, New Zealand, Lord Howe Island, and other islands in the Pacific Ocean. In New South Wales, it is often seen as an epiphyte or growing on rocks in rainforests. Tiny flowers form on a spike, at the end of the branchlets. The specific epithet tetraphylla is from the Ancient Greek language, meaning \"four leaves\", though the species may also have whorls of 3.\n\n\n== References =="
