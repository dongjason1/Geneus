    "__SUMMARY__": "Phyllostachys virella is a hardy running bamboo with culms that grow thick relative to its height with a subtle scent suggestive of sandalwood.",
    "Description": "This bamboo grows with an expected height to 9 m (30 ft) with a culm diameter to 5 cm (2 in).\nNew culms are green, paling with age, with all green internodes that later develop white powdery rings at maturity.\nCulm sheath colors appear grey-green with burgundy or purple margins with larger sheaths sparsely strewn with small spots.\nSimilar to Phyllostachys atrovaginata, rubbing the culms of this bamboo may release an aroma reminiscent of sandalwood.",
    "Distribution": "This bamboo grows in areas ranging from subtropical to temperate and tolerates winter low temperatures better than most bamboos.\nIts natural distribution in China is found in Zhejiang Province.",
    "Name": "Its common name of \"green skin bamboo\" or \"Dongyang green skin bamboo\"\ntranslates directly from the Chinese name, Dongyang being a city-level county in the central area of Zhejiang Province.",
