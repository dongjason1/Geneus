    "__SUMMARY__": "Dendrocalamus sinicus, the dragon bamboo, is a gigantic clumping bamboo native to Yunnan Province of China and to Laos. It has the largest culms of any known species of bamboo; up to 14.5 inches (37 cm) wide with culm walls up to 2.3 inches (6 cm) thick and the culm up to 151 feet (46 meters) in height. Each culm can weigh up to 990 pounds (450 kg) apiece.  A plant eventually consists of about one hundred culms. This species was unknown to science prior to 1980, although of course well known to the citizens of Yunnan and Laos for centuries.\n\n\n== References =="
