    "__SUMMARY__": "Phyllostachys atrovaginata is a running bamboo with strongly tapered, stiff, upright culms. It may reveal a fragrant scent during warm weather or when vigorously rubbed.\n\nThe common name of \"incense bamboo\" comes from the unique aroma.\n\nIts culms grow large in diameter relative to height.\n\nMaximum height can reach 10 m (33 ft) with a maximum culm diameter of 7.0 cm (2.7 in).\n\nThis bamboo grows in areas ranging from subtropical to temperate and tolerates winter temperatures down to -23 °C (-10 °F),\n\nbeing a more cold-hardy bamboo.\n\nLike water bamboo, the rhizomes and roots of this species also have air canals as an adaptation for living in wet soil.\n\nThe specific epithet atrovaginata or \"dark-sheathed\" is inspired from the dark green and deep red wine colors of the culm sheaths.\nP. atrovaginata has formerly  been called Phyllostachys congesta.\nEdible shoots can be harvested in spring from this cultivated species, while the culms can be used split or unsplit for weaving or crafting bamboo articles.\n\n\n== References =="
