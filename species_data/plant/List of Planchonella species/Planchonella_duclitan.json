    "__SUMMARY__": "Planchonella duclitan is a species of plant in the family Sapotaceae. A tree that may attain a height of 40 metres, presenting glossy leaves and orange fruit. It is common on Christmas Island, dominating up to 20% of the upper leaf canopy, as a tree to 30 metres, in established forest or around 40% in regenerating habitat where it may attain the maximum height.The species has been described as Planchonella nitida (Blume) Dubard, later regarded as a synonym for this treatment.\nThe tree is used as a nest site by Abbott's booby, a sea-bird species Papasula abbotti, and fruit and flowers provide food for the fruit bat Pteropus natalis.\n\n\n== References =="
