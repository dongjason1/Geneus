    "__SUMMARY__": "Utricularia fimbriata is a small to medium-sized, probably perennial carnivorous plant that belongs to the genus Utricularia. U. fimbriata is endemic to Colombia and Venezuela. It grows as a terrestrial plant in damp, sandy soils in savannas at altitudes from near sea level to 300 m (984 ft). It was originally described and published by Carl Sigismund Kunth in 1818. In 1913, John Hendley Barnhart treated this species as part of a new genus, Aranella, which was later reduced to the taxonomic rank of section within the genus Utricularia, thus bringing the species back to the original genus.",
