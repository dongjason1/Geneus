    "__SUMMARY__": "Utricularia aureomaculata is a small, probably annual, lithophyte carnivorous plant that belongs to the genus Utricularia. U. aureomaculata is endemic to Venezuela and is only known from three locations: the type location on Ptari-tepuí in the Venezuelan state of Bolívar, one other location from Ptari-tepuí, and also from Amaruay-tepuí. It grows as a terrestrial lithophyte on moist mossy bluffs. It has been collected in flower in May, October, and November. It was originally described and published by Julian Alfred Steyermark in 1953.",
