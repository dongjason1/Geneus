    "__SUMMARY__": "Utricularia cochleata is a small, bryophyllous, lithophytic carnivorous plant that belongs to the genus Utricularia. It is endemic to Brazil and is only known from the type location in Goiás. It grows as a terrestrial lithophyte on mossy rocks within range of the spray of a waterfall. The species epithet cochleata refers to the shell-like shape of the recurved corolla. U. cochleata was first collected in 2004 and formally described by Claudia Petean Bove in 2008.",
