    "__SUMMARY__": "Utricularia heterosepala is a small carnivorous plant that belongs to the genus Utricularia.\nIt is endemic to the Philippines, where it can be found on the islands of Palawan, Luzon, and Sibuyan. U. heterosepala grows as a subaquatic plant in shallow water or creeks, usually at low to medium altitudes.\nIt was originally described and published by Ludwig Benjamin in 1847. U. heterosepala is distinct from the rest of the members in section Oligocista by apparently always lacking bracteoles.",
