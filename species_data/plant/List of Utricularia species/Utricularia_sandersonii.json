    "__SUMMARY__": "Utricularia sandersonii, Sanderson’s bladderwort, is a species of flowering plant in the bladderwort family. Originally described and published by the British botanist Daniel Oliver in 1865, it is a carnivorous evergreen perennial, endemic to northern KwaZulu-Natal and Transkei in South Africa.",
    "Description": "Up to 50 cm (20 in) tall and broad, it grows as a lithophyte on wet, often vertical rocky surfaces at altitudes from 210 m (689 ft) to 1,200 m (3,937 ft). Carnivory occurs beneath the surface,  whereby tiny bladders on underground stems capture the micro-organisms which inhabit saturated soil. The visible parts of the plant are not carnivorous. Above ground it bears quantities of white flowers with pale blue markings, long forward-curved spurs and double lobes which resemble rabbits’ ears.",
    "Cultivation": "Utricularia sandersonii thrives in conditions that are relatively easy to replicate at home, and so has become a popular houseplant which can tolerate temperatures down to 1 °C (34 °F), but not freezing. It must be kept moist at all times in full sun. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit.",
    "Invasive plant": "U. sandersonii is listed on the New Zealand National Pest Plant Accord since it is an invasive species.",
