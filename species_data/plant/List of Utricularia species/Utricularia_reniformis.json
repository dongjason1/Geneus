    "__SUMMARY__": "Utricularia reniformis is a large perennial carnivorous plant that belongs to the genus Utricularia. U. reniformis is endemic to Brazil. It was originally published and described by Augustin Saint-Hilaire in 1830. It usually grows as a terrestrial plant in wet grasslands and only sometimes as an epiphyte in the water-filled leaf axils of some bromeliad species. It is typically found between altitudes of 750 m (2,461 ft) and 1,900 m (6,234 ft) in its southern range and up to 2,500 m (8,202 ft) in its northern range. It has been collected in flower between October and March.",
