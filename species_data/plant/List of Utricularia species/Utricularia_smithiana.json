    "__SUMMARY__": "Utricularia smithiana is a medium-sized, probably perennial carnivorous plant that belongs to the genus Utricularia. It is endemic to India. U. smithiana grows as a terrestrial or affixed subaquatic plant in swamps or shallow water pools at medium and high altitudes. It was originally described by Robert Wight in 1849, reduced to a variety of U. caerulea by Charles Baron Clarke in 1884, and later reinstated as U. smithiana.",
