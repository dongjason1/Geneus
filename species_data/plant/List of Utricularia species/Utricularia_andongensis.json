    "__SUMMARY__": "Utricularia andongensis is a small, probably perennial, carnivorous plant that belongs to the genus Utricularia. It is endemic to tropical Africa, where it can be found in Angola, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, and Zambia. U. andongensis grows as a terrestrial or lithophytic plant on wet, bare rocks or among mosses in grasslands at altitudes from 240 m (787 ft) to 1,800 m (5,906 ft). It was originally named by Friedrich Welwitsch but formally described and published by William Philip Hiern in 1900.",
