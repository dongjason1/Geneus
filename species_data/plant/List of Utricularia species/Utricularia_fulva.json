U. fulva is endemic to Australia, where it appears to be largely restricted to the Northern Territory, specifically the Arnhem Land sandstone escarpment. It grows as a terrestrial or subaquatic plant in or near sandy stream beds. It was originally described and published by Ferdinand von Mueller in 1858.",
