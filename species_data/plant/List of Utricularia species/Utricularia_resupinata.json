    "__SUMMARY__": "Utricularia resupinata, the lavender bladderwort or northeastern bladderwort, is a small perennial affixed subaquatic carnivorous plant that belongs to the genus Utricularia (family Lentibulariaceae). It is native to eastern Canada, United States, and Central America. In its northern range it appears to only flower when low water levels occur at the same time as higher than average temperatures. It was thought to be extirpated in Indiana until it was rediscovered in 2005.",
