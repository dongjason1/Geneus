U. heterochroma is endemic to Venezuela, where it is known from the type location at Ptari-tepui, two collections from Toronó-tepui, one collection from Apacará-tepui, one collection from Serrania Guanay, and several collections from the Chimantá Massif. It grows as a rheophyte on wet sandstone cliffs near waterfalls among mosses at altitudes from 1,760 m (5,774 ft) to 2,450 m (8,038 ft).
