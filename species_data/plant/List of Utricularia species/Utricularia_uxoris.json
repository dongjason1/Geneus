    "__SUMMARY__": "Utricularia uxoris is a small epiphytic carnivorous plant in the genus Utricularia that is endemic to Costa Rica. It is distinguished from all other members of section Orchidioides in having green glabrous flowers with a white spur and its small size. The species is only known from its type locality in Reserva Biológica El Copal, Cartago Province. It was collected in 2004 by Jorge Gómez-Laurito, Diego Salazar, and Jorge Carmona and then formally described in 2005 by Gómez-Laurito (2005).\nUtricularia uxoris is possibly just a form or variety of U. jamesoniana,  but Gómez-Laurito indicated in his original description of U. uxoris that it has shallow corolla lobe divisions, compared to the deeply dissected corolla lobes found on U. jamesoniana flowers.",
