    "__SUMMARY__": "Utricularia purpureocaerulea is a small, probably perennial, carnivorous plant that belongs to the genus Utricularia. U. purpureocaerulea is endemic to the Brazilian states of Bahia, Goiás, and Minas Gerais and is only known from six collections in these locations. It grows as a terrestrial plant in damp, sandy soils among rocks at altitudes from 1,000 m (3,281 ft) to 1,600 m (5,249 ft). U. purpureocaerulea was originally described and published by Augustin Saint-Hilaire and Frédéric de Girard in 1838.",
