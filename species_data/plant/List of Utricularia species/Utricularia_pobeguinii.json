    "__SUMMARY__": "Utricularia pobeguinii is a small annual carnivorous plant that belongs to the genus Utricularia. It is endemic to Africa and is only found in the region around Kindia, Guinea. U. pobeguinii grows as a terrestrial plant in wet soils among sandstone at altitudes from 500 m (1,640 ft) to 1,000 m (3,281 ft). It was originally described by François Pellegrin in 1914, reduced to a variety of U. spiralis by Peter Taylor in 1963, and later elevated back to the species level by Taylor upon further investigation.",
