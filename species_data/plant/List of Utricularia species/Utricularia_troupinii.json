    "__SUMMARY__": "Utricularia troupinii is a small, probably annual, carnivorous plant that belongs to the genus Utricularia. It is endemic to Burundi and Rwanda. U. troupinii grows as a terrestrial plant in wet grasslands or marshes at altitudes from 1,900 m (6,234 ft) to 2,500 m (8,202 ft). It was originally described and published by Peter Taylor in 1971, but was identified in 1964 by Taylor as a possible short spurred form of U. welwitschii.",
