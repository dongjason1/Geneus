    "__SUMMARY__": "Utricularia recta is a small, probably annual carnivorous plant that belongs to the genus Utricularia. It is native to Bhutan, China, India, and Nepal. U. recta grows as a terrestrial plant in marshes and bogs from altitudes around 900 m (2,953 ft) to 4,000 m (13,123 ft). It was originally described as a variety of U. wallichiana by Daniel Oliver in 1859. It was later transferred to a variety of U. scandens by Krishnaier Subramanyam and Banerjee in 1968. Peter Taylor elevated the variety to the specific rank in 1986 upon further review of its morphological characteristics.",
