    "__SUMMARY__": "Utricularia odorata is a medium-sized, probably perennial carnivorous plant that belongs to the genus Utricularia. It is native to southeastern Asia (Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam) and northern Australia (Northern Territory). U. odorata grows as a terrestrial plant in wet grasslands at low altitudes. It was originally described by François Pellegrin in 1920. The specific epithet odorata is derived from reports that the flowers are fragrant.",
