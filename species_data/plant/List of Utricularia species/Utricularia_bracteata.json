U. bracteata is endemic to southern tropical Africa, where it has only been found at the type location in Angola, two other collections also in Angola, a collection in northern Zambia, and another from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It grows as a terrestrial plant in peaty grasslands at altitudes from 1,000 m (3,281 ft) to 1,500 m (4,921 ft). It was originally described and published by Ronald D'Oyley Good in 1924.",
