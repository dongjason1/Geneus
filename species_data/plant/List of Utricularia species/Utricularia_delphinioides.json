    "__SUMMARY__": "Utricularia delphinioides is a small to medium-sized, probably perennial, carnivorous plant that belongs to the genus Utricularia. It is endemic to Indochina and can be found in Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam. U. delphinioides grows as a terrestrial plant in swamps and rice fields, wet grasslands, or open pine forests at altitudes from near sea level to 1,300 m (4,265 ft). It was originally named by Clovis Thorel but formally described and published by François Pellegrin in 1920. A variety, U. delphinioides var. minor, was also described in 1920, but Peter Taylor reduced the variety to synonymy under U. delphinioides because he discovered a continuous range of sizes between the larger and smaller forms, size being the only distinctive characteristic in the 1920 description of the variety.",
