    "__SUMMARY__": "Utricularia reticulata is a medium to large-sized, probably annual carnivorous plant that belongs to the genus Utricularia. It is native to India and Sri Lanka. U. reticulata grows as a terrestrial or subaquatic plant in marshy grasslands or wet soils over rocks at lower altitudes up to 750 m (2,461 ft). It is also a common weed found in rice fields. U. reticulata was originally described by James Edward Smith in 1808, but he did not cite a specimen and instead referred to a botanical print in Hendrik van Rheede's 1689 Hortus Malabaricus.",
