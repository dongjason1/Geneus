    "__SUMMARY__": "Phacelia exilis is a species of phacelia known by the common names Transverse Range phacelia and lavender windows. It is endemic to California, where it is known from the southern Sierra Nevada and the Transverse Ranges. It grows in mountain and foothill habitat such as slopes and meadows.\nThe Phacelia exilis plant is similar to Phacelia mohavensis and was considered a variety of that species until 1988, when it was separated on the basis of consistent morphological differences and named a distinct species.",

The leaves are lance-shaped and smooth-edged, measuring 1 to 3.5 centimeters in length. The hairy inflorescence is a one-sided curving or coiling cyme of bell-shaped flowers.
