The inflorescence is a one-sided coiling cyme of bell-shaped flowers. Each flower is up to 6 millimeters long and greenish or yellowish white in color with whiskery protruding stamens.\nThere are two subspecies:\nPhacelia nemoralis ssp. oregonensis (Oregon phacelia) – distribution extends into Washington State\nPhacelia nemoralis ssp. nemoralis – occurs south of Washington",
