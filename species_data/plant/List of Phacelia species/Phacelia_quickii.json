He was a forest ecologist for the U.S. Forest Service and a plant pathologist and consultant for the Pacific Southwest Forest and Range Experimental Station. Some of his areas of research included seed germination, dormancy and longevity, ecology of forests and forest species, and chemical control of plants and tree diseases. He wrote articles on gooseberries, blister rust, fungicides and germination of Ceanothus seeds.",
