    "__SUMMARY__": "Mahonia fortunei  is a species of shrubs in the family Berberidaceae, the barberry family, described as a species in 1846. It is endemic to China, found in the provinces of Chongqing, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Taiwan, and Zhejiang. It is grown as an ornamental in many lands, with common names including Chinese mahonia, Fortune's mahonia, and holly grape.Some authorities place the genus Mahonia in Berberis because there is no definite morphological distinction between the two genera. The subject awaits in-depth genetic analysis.",

It has a slow to moderate rate of growth and a moderate density. The leaves are odd-pinnately compound and alternately arranged.
