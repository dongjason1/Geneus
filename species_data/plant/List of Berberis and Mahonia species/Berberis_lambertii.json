    "__SUMMARY__": "Berberis lambertii is a shrub in the family Berberidaceae described as a species in 1921. It is known only from the Chamoli and Pithoragarh districts of Uttarakhand in northern India. The species was long thought to be extinct because it had been collected in nearly 100 years until living populations were discovered recently.\n\n\n== References =="
