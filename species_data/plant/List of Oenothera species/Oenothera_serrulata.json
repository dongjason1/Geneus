Other common names include halfshrub sundrop, serrate-leaved evening primrose, shrubby evening primrose, plains yellow primrose, and halfleaf sundrop. It is native to central North America, including central Canada and the central United States.This plant is a subshrub that branches and forms a bushy clump up to 46 centimetres (18 inches) tall. The toothed leaves are up to 8.9 centimetres (3.5 inches) long. The yellow flowers bloom between March and November. They open in the morning and close in the afternoon. They fade orange or pink with age. The fruit is a cylindrical capsule.This drought- and heat-tolerant species grows in many types of substrate, including caliche, limestone, and gypsum. The leaves turn so that their edges face the sun, an adaptation to hot conditions.",
