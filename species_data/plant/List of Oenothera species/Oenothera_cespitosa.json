    "__SUMMARY__": "Oenothera caespitosa, known commonly as tufted evening primrose, desert evening primrose, rock-rose evening primrose, or fragrant evening primrose, is a perennial plant of the genus Oenothera native to much of western and central North America. It produces a rosette of lobed or toothed leaves each up to 36 centimeters long around a woody caudex.  It is normally night-blooming.\nThere are many subtaxa, referred to as subspecies or varieties.\nOenothera caespitosa grows to 10 centimeters (4 inches) tall. It is good for rock gardens. The 4-petaled white flowers open at dusk and wilt the next morning, turning pink.It is a larval host to the white-lined sphinx moth.",
    "Pollination": "Oenothera caespitosa is dependent on hawkmoths, including the five-spotted hawkmoth (Manduca quinquemaculata) for pollination.",
