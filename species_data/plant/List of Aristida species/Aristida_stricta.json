    "__SUMMARY__": "Aristida stricta is a warm-season grass, native to North America, that dominates understory vegetation in sandhills and flatwoods coastal plain ecosystems of the Carolinas in the Southeastern United States. It is known as wiregrass (due to its texture) and pineland three-awn grass.\nIts common name, wiregrass, gave rise to the naming of the Wiregrass Region in which it is located.\nThis is a fast-growing species that regenerates quickly after fires. The plant depends on regular summer burning in order to stimulate flowering and seed production.",
