    "__SUMMARY__": "Rhododendron mucronulatum, the Korean rhododendron or Korean rosebay (Chinese: 银叶杜鹃; pinyin: yínyè dùjuān), is a rhododendron species native to Korea, Mongolia, Russia, and parts of northern China. It is a deciduous shrub that grows to 1–2 m (3.3–6.6 ft) in height, with elliptic or elliptic-lanceolate leaves, 3–7 cm (1 1⁄4–2 3⁄4 in) long by 1–3.5 cm (3⁄8–1 3⁄8 in) wide. The reddish-purple flowers appear in late winter or early spring, often on the bare branches before the foliage unfurls. It inhabits forested regions at 1,600–2,300 m (5,200–7,500 ft).\nThe Latin specific epithet mucronulatum means \"sharply pointed\", referring to the leaf shape.",
    "Synonyms": "Rhododendron dauricum var. mucronulatum (Turcz.) Maxim.\nRhododendron dauricum subsp. mucronulatum (Turcz.) Vorosch.",
    "Cultivation": "The cultivar 'Cornell Pink' has light pink flowers, and has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. It is hardy down to −20 °C (−4 °F) but like most rhododendron species requires a sheltered position in dappled shade with acid soil that has been enriched with leaf mould.",
    "Culinary use": "In Korea, the flowers are used in pan-fried flower cakes called hwajeon, which are traditional for Samjinnal, a spring festival. It is also used in infused liquor.",
