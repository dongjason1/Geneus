    "__SUMMARY__": "Rhododendron atlanticum (Greek Ροδόδενδρο) (dwarf azalea or coastal azalea), is a species of Rhododendron native to coastal areas of the eastern United States, from New Jersey south to Georgia.\nIt is a deciduous shrub 50–150 cm tall, forming a thick understory in forests, spreading by underground stolons. The leaves are 3–5 cm long and 1–2 cm broad, bluish green, and hairless or with scattered glandular hairs. The fragrant flowers are 3–4 cm long, usually white to pink, sometimes with a bit of yellow; they are produced in trusses of 4-10 together.",
    "Cultivation and uses": "It is not widely cultivated in North America, but has been introduced and is popular in England. In the U.S. it is regarded as a good plant for heavy soils, but will spread itself too freely if planted in sandy soils.",
