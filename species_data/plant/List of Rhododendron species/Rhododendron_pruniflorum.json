    "__SUMMARY__": "Rhododendron pruniflorum, commonly known as the plum-flowered rhododendron, is an open, often rather leggy 1–1.5 m high shrub found in northern Burma and nearby parts of India at elevations up to 4000m. It occurs in coniferous woodlands that are dominated by species of fir (Abies).The leaves are often glaucous, are aromatic and the undersides have a coating of fine, pale grey scales. As the name pruniflorum (plum-flowered) suggests, the small, waxy flowers are an typically an unusual plum-purple-red shade, though they may also be mauve to pink. The heads of 3–10 small flowers open late, not until early summer at higher elevations.\n\n\n== References =="
