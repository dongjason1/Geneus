    "__SUMMARY__": "Rhododendron williamsianum (Chinese: 圆叶杜鹃; pinyin: yuányè dùjuān), the Williams rhododendron, is a species of flowering plant in the heath family Ericaceae. It is native to forested slopes at 1,800–2,800 m (5,900–9,200 ft) in western Guizhou, southwestern Sichuan, southeastern Xizang and northeastern Yunnan in southern and western China.\nGrowing to 1.5 m (4.9 ft) tall and broad, it is a compact evergreen shrub with rounded matt green leaves and rose pink bell-shaped flowers in spring.\nIn cultivation in the UK, Rhododendron williamsianum has gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit. It is hardy down to −15 °C (5 °F) but like most rhododendron species requires a sheltered position in dappled shade with acid soil that has been enriched with leaf mould.\n\n\n== References =="
