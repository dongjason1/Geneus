    "__SUMMARY__": "Baeckea imbricata, commonly known as heath myrtle, is a heathland shrub found in coastal areas and nearby ranges in New South Wales and Queensland in Australia. It grows to 1 metre high and  has small ovate leaves that are 3–6 mm long and 2.5 to 5 mm wide. White flowers appear between spring and late summer.The species was formally described by German botanist Joseph Gaertner in 1788, based on a specimen at the herbarium of Joseph Banks.  Gaertner gave the new species the name Jungia imbricata. In 1917 the species was transferred to the genus Baeckea by British botanist George Claridge Druce. The specific epithet imbricata is derived from Latin, referring to the overlapping leaves.\n\n\n== References =="
