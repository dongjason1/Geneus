    "__SUMMARY__": "Baeckea brevifolia is a common heathland shrub found in coastal central New South Wales, Australia. It grows up to one metre high. The habitat is mostly on poor sandstone soils, in areas of moderate to high rainfall, frequented by fire. It is often found growing by the sea. The specific epithet brevifolia is from the Latin, meaning \"short-leaved\".\n\n\n== References =="
