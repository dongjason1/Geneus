    "__SUMMARY__": "Baeckea ovalifolia is a common heathland shrub found in coastal areas of Western Australia.The erect shrub typically grows to a height of between 0.5 to 2 metres (2 to 7 ft) and has linear oblong to ovate shaped leaves that are 3 to 6 millimetres (0.12 to 0.24 in) in length. It blooms from May and November producing pink-white flowers that have a diameter of approximately 15 mm (0.59 in).It is often found on rocky slopes growing in sandy soils among quartzite or granite in a small area along the south coast of Western Australia.\nThe species was first formally described as Harmogia ovalifolia by the botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1860 in the work Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae and later reclassified into the Baeckea genera by Mueller in 1864.",
