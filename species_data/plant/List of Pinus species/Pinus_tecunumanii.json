    "__SUMMARY__": "Pinus tecunumanii (syn. Pinus oocarpa var. ochoterenae Martínez; Pinus patula Schiede & Deppe spp. tecunumanii Eguiluz & Perry) is a timber tree native to Mexico and Central America. It grows from the highlands of Chiapas and Oaxaca through Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras  to Nicaragua (17° to 14° North latitude). It occurs in two separated populations in their native habitats. High altitude group grows at 1500–2900 m and low altitude group from 500–1500 m.\nIt has been cultivated in several subtropical parts of the world for paper industry. Cultivation trials have shown that high elevation sources are the most productive. It grows well in Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil and South Africa.\nWood: Yellowish color.\nFormerly classified as a subspecies of Pinus patula, DNA analysis has shown that is a different species and that is closer to Pinus oocarpa.\nIt is also used in paper production.",
