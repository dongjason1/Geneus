    "__SUMMARY__": "Pinus pseudostrobus, known in English as the smooth-bark Mexican pine and in Spanish as chamite or pacingo, is a tree endemic to Mexico.\nIt is 8 to 25 m tall, dense and round top, the bark is brown and fissured and smooth when young. It grows between 1300–3250 m. From 26° to 15° north latitude, from Sinaloa, Mexico to El Salvador and Honduras. It occurs within a rainfalls regime mostly in summer. A stand of about 15 fully mature Mexican pines is in Imperial County, California, at the Palo Verde County Park, in a narrow strip of land between Hwy 78 and the Colorado River.\nIt has been introduced in New Zealand near sea level and has done well.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== References =="
