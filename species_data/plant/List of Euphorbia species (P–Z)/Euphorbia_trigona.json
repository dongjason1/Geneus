    "__SUMMARY__": "Euphorbia trigona (also known as African milk tree, cathedral cactus, Abyssinian euphorbia, and high chaparall) is a perennial plant that originates from Central Africa.",
    "Description": "It has an upright stem and number of branches that also grow upward. The stem and branches can have two or three sides. The stem itself is dark green with V-shaped light green patterns. The about 5mm long thorns are placed in pairs of two on the stem's ridges. The drop shaped leaves grow from between the two thorns on each ridge. The plant has never been known to flower, and is possibly a hybrid.",
    "Cultivation": "The trigona can withstand brief cold temperatures of up to -3 degrees. It prefers sandy soil but can withstand most types of well-drained soil. It can root easily from stem cuttings, if allowed to dry for 3–7 days before planting so that it can form a callus and not rot. It grows from 1.5 – 3 meters.",
    "Chemistry": "As with many other Euphorbia species, the latex from the plant is poisonous and can cause skin irritations. It is a pest-free plant. A problem that some trigonas face is that they are susceptible to  falling over when fully grown because of their shallow and small root system",
    "Uses": "The plant is only known in human cultivation and is commonly used as a house plant.  It is used as a ritual plant and a hedge in Gabon.",
