    "__SUMMARY__": "Euphorbia remyi (syn. Chamaesyce remyi) is a rare species of flowering plant in the euphorb family known by the common name Remy's sandmat. It is endemic to the island of Kauaʻi in Hawaii, where it grows in mixed mesic forests, wet forests and bogs from 150 to 900 m (490 to 2,950 ft). Like other Hawaiian euphorbs, this plant is known locally as ʻakoko.\nThere are two remaining varieties of this species, vars. remyi and kauaiensis, both of which were federally listed as endangered species in 2010. The third variety, var. hanaleiensis, has been declared extinct, having not been located since the nineteenth century.",
