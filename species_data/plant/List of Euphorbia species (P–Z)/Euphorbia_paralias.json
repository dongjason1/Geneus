    "__SUMMARY__": "Euphorbia paralias, the sea spurge, is a species of Euphorbia, native to Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia.It is a glaucous perennial plant growing up to 70 cm tall. The crowded leaves are elliptic-ovate (ovate toward the top of the stems) and 5 to 20 mm long.The species is  widely naturalised in Australia. It invades coastal areas, displacing local species and colonising open sand areas favoured by certain nesting birds.  Major eradication programmes have been undertaken in some areas, for example by Sea Spurge Remote Area Teams in Tasmania, with great success.\n\n\n== References =="
