    "__SUMMARY__": "Baccharis salicifolia is a blooming shrub native to the sage scrub community and desert southwest of the United States and northern Mexico, as well as parts of South America. Its usual common name is mule fat; it is also called seepwillow or water-wally. This is a large bush with sticky foliage which bears plentiful small, fuzzy, pink or red-tinged white flowers which are highly attractive to butterflies. The long pointed leaves may be toothed and contain three lengthwise veins. It is most common near water sources.",
    "Uses": "The Kayenta Navajo people use this plant in a compound infusion of plants used as a lotion for chills from immersion.Another use is fire starting. Dried Baccharis salicifolia has a very low ignition temperature, very similar to the dried yucca stock. It can be used for spindels and hand-drill shafts.",
