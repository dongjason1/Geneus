    "__SUMMARY__": "Stenocereus queretaroensis is a species of cactus from Mexico, including the state of Querétaro. It is cultivated for its fruit.Plants are tall, up to 5–6 m (16–20 ft), with a central trunk followed by many upturned branches, producing a candelabra-like shape. The stems are around 15 cm (6 in) across and have six to eight very distinct ribs. The areoles produce five to nine whitish radial spines, up to 2 cm (0.8 in) long, and one to four somewhat grayer central spines, of which the lower are longer, up to 4 cm (1.6 in). The scented white flowers are borne from the sides of the ends of the stems and are 10–12 cm (3.9–4.7 in) long.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References =="
