    "__SUMMARY__": "Achimenes longiflora has many common names including Cupid's bow, nut-orchid, and magic flower.\nIt can grow up to 24 inches (61 cm) long, arising from small rhizomes. The hairy leaves have saw toothed edges and can be up to 3.5 in (89 mm) long and 1.5 in (38 mm) wide. The flowers are produced from June to October and are usually blue with a white throat. They can be quite large – up to 2 in (51 mm) long and 3 in (76 mm) across.\nThis flor de peña (rock flower) was collected and documented in late summer blooming on  embankments and along roadsides at intermediate elevations in Guatemala in the 1970s by Carol Rogers Chickering.\n\n\n== References =="
