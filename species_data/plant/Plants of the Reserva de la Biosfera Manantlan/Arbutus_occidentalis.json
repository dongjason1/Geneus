    "__SUMMARY__": "Arbutus occidentalis is a shrub species in the heath family, that is endemic to Mexico. It is sometimes locally known as Western Mexican Madrone. It is a very rare species that is only found in scattered locations in Western Mexico. It is closely related to the Pacific Madrone of the Pacific Northwest. Like many Madrone species, the berries are a traditional snack in Mexico.",
    "Distribution": "The plant is found in montane Mexico from Chihuahua to Oaxaca.  It is found in pine forests, spreading on cliff summits and steep rocky slopes.",
    "Description": "Arbutus occidentalis is a low growing shrub, growing 0.25–1 metre (0.82–3.28 ft) in height. In places it forms colonies more than 6 feet (1.8 m) ) wide.The branches are covered with thin red bark. Leaves are 3–6 centimetres (1.2–2.4 in) long, by 1–2 centimetres (0.39–0.79 in) wide. They have teeth along the edges.The red fruits are about 0.5 inches (13 mm) across and fleshy.",
    "Description-Variations": "Two regional variations of Arbutus occidentalis were formerly distinguished as varieties\n\nArbutus occidentalis var. occidentalis  —almost smooth leaved, in Central Mexico from Durango to Jalisco in the Sierra Madre Occidental.\nArbutus occidentalis var. villosa — leaves copiously covered beneath with wooly, villous hairs, further south from Michoacan to Oaxaca in the Sierra Madre del Sur.\n\n\n== References =="
