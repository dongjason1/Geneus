    "__SUMMARY__": "Juglans major (literally, the larger walnut), also known as Arizona walnut, is a walnut tree which grows to 50 ft tall (15 m) with a DBH of up to 0.61 metres (2 ft) at elevations of 300–2,130 m (1,000–7,000 ft) in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah.  It also occurs in Mexico as far south as Guerrero. Common names include Arizona black walnut (as it belongs to the \"black walnuts\" section Juglans sect. Rhysocaryon), and the Spanish name nogal cimarrón  (cimarron walnut).",
    "Description": "In moister areas, the tree features a single, stout trunk; there are usually several slender trunks in drier situations. The 8–14 in long pinnately compound leaves bear 9–15 lanceolate leaflets, 19–32 mm (.75–1.25 in) wide by 51–102 mm (2–4 in) long.  The small nut has a thick shell with deep grooves enclosing an oily, edible seed.Where the range of J. major overlaps that of J. microcarpa, the two interbreed, producing many intermediate forms.",
