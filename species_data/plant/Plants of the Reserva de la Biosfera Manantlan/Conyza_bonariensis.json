    "__SUMMARY__": "Erigeron bonariensis is a species of Erigeron, found throughout the tropics and subtropics as a pioneer plant; its precise origin is unknown, but most likely it stems from Central America or South America. It has become naturalized in many other regions. Common names include flax-leaf fleabane, wavy-leaf fleabane, Argentine fleabane, and hairy fleabane.Erigeron bonariensis is a rare alien in south eastern England, found beneath walls and in cracks in pavements and concrete driveways. It flowers in August and continues fruiting until the first frosts (sometimes as late as Christmas Day in Berkshire). It is instantly recognisable by its blue-green foliage, very narrow, undulate leaves, and purple-tipped involucral bracts.\nErigeron bonariensis grows up to 75 cm (29.5 in) in height and its leaves are covered with stiff hairs, including long hairs near the apex of the bracts. Its flower heads have white ray florets and yellow disc florets. It can easily be confused with Erigeron canadensis, which grows taller, and C. albida.\n\n\n== References =="
