It is generally 1–1.5 m (3.3–4.9 ft) tall, occasionally up to 3 m (9.8 ft). Stems are hairy, and square in cross section. Leaves are oppositely arranged, 2–10 cm (0.79–3.94 in) long, with shallowly toothed margins, and emit a strong minty odor if crushed. Flowers are pink or purple, arranged in clusters of 1-5 in the upper leaf axils.",
