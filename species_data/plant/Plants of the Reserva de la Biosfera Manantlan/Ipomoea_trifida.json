    "__SUMMARY__": "Ipomoea trifida is a species of Ipomoea morning glory also known as the threefork morning glory. It is native to the Caribbean, Mexico, and South America. I. trifida is known for being the closest living wild relative to I. batatas, or the common sweet potato, and is believed to have split from this relative at least 800,000 years ago. The roots of this plant are thin and inedible, while the flowers tend to be purple.",
