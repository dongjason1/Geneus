    "__SUMMARY__": "Euphorbia caput-medusae (\"Medusa's Head\") is a plant of the genus Euphorbia that occurs in and around Cape Town, South Africa.\nThis succulent resembles the head of Medusa, with many serpent-like stems arising from a short, central caudex. It is still common around Cape Town where it grows in deep sand or rocky outcrops on the coast. It is particularly common in the Peninsula Shale Renosterveld vegetation of Signal Hill. They sometimes exceed 1 metre in diameter, partly buried in the ground, covered with numerous crowded branches.Euphorbia caput-medusae was introduced to the Netherlands around 1700 and was one of the early plants described by Linnaeus (Species Plantarum, 1753).",
