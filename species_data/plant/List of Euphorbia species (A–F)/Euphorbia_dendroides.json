    "__SUMMARY__": "Euphorbia dendroides, also known as tree spurge, is a small tree of the family Euphorbiaceae that grows in semi-arid and mediterranean climates.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "It has a wide distribution in the Mediterranean Basin, from the Iberian Peninsula to Egypt. This plant is sensitive to frost, so it only grows on protected and sunny mountainsides in hilly areas. It has been introduced to other countries out of its original range as an ornamental tree.",
    "Description": "This bush also has uses in traditional medicine; like many other species of genus Euphorbia its toxic white and sticky sap has been used to treat skin excrescences, like cancers, tumors, and warts since ancient times.",
