    "__SUMMARY__": "Lithocarpus dodonaeifolius is a species of tree in the family Fagaceae. L. dodonaeifolius is a medium-sized tree, up to 9 m (30 ft) tall. It is endemic to Taiwan and only occurs in the Hengchun Peninsula in the extreme south of the country. It grows in mixed mesophytic forests at altitudes of 500–1,500 m (1,600–4,900 ft).Lithocarpus dodonaeifolius is similar to L. formosanus, and their identity as separate species has been questioned. Molecular genetic methods suggest that they are closely related but distinct species.\n\n\n== References =="
