    "__SUMMARY__": "Lithocarpus edulis (Japanese stone oak) is a species of stone-oak native to Japan. It is an evergreen tree growing up to 15 metres tall. The nuts are edible for people but taste bitter. The nuts contain tannins, however soaking them in water removes them. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant.\nAccording to Japanese Wikipedia and staff at a Japanese museum specialized in the culture of the ancient Japanese people Jōmon, it doesn’t contain that much tannin or bitter taste and is regarded as the most edible oak nut since it doesn’t need to be soaked in water to draw out the bitter taste. Edulis is latin for ”edible” after all.",
