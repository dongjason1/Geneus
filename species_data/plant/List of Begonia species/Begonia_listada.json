    "__SUMMARY__": "Begonia listada (striped begonia) is a species of flowering plant in the family Begoniaceae, native to Brazil. It is a compact shrublike evergreen begonia growing to 0.5 metres (20 in), bearing succulent green leaves with a prominent rib of lighter green, and a reddish underside. It produces small pink-tinted white flowers intermittently throughout the year. As it does not tolerate temperatures below 10 °C (50 °F), in temperate regions it must be grown under glass.This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\n\n== References =="
