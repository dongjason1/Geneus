    "__SUMMARY__": "Begonia grandis, the hardy begonia, is a plant in the begonia family, Begoniaceae. It is a herbaceous plant with alternate, simple leaves on arching stems. The flowers are pink or white, borne in dichotomously branching cymes from late summer through fall in USDA U.S. Hardiness Zone 7. As the common name \"hardy begonia\" implies, it is winter hardy in some temperate regions.\nIt can overwinter well in hardiness zone 9a in southwestern Japan as tuberous roots or bulbils (bulbils are formed in axils). Above-ground parts of this plant eventually die as temperature lowers. However, it is generally regarded as hardy to zones 6-7.\n\n\n== References =="
