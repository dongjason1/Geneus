The species name indicates an original description in the Celebes (Sulawesi) and it is found throughout Malesia, with local names (especially Borneo) including: Kalawet, Kandis, Kandis pulan, Manggis, Manggis hutan, Perda-perda and Sungkep.Based on the above, the species is a tropical forest main canopy tree some 25–30 m high in Vietnam, or up to 36 m tall and 0.93 m dbh in Indonesia; trunks and stems can exude white to yellow latex.  The leaves are approximately 130 x 60 mm.  \nFlowers are yellowish, approximately 12 mm.  \nFruits are ovoid up to 45 mm: with  5-10 segments.",
