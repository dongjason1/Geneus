    "__SUMMARY__": "Nepenthes mira (; from Latin mirus \"wonderful\") is a highland pitcher plant endemic to Palawan in the Philippines. It grows at elevations of 1550–1605 m above sea level.Nepenthes mira was formally described by Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek in 1998. The authors suggest that N. mira is related to the Bornean species N. edwardsiana, N. macrophylla, and N. villosa. In his Carnivorous Plant Database, taxonomist Jan Schlauer treats this species as a heterotypic synonym of N. deaniana.Nepenthes mira has no known natural hybrids. No forms or varieties have been described.",
