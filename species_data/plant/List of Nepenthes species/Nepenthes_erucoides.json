    "__SUMMARY__": "Nepenthes erucoides is a tropical pitcher plant endemic to Mount Redondo, the highest peak on the Philippine island of Dinagat, where it occurs from c. 800 m to the summit at 929 m. It grows on a very thin substrate consisting of \"lateritic nickel ore and decomposed chromite rubble, through to a clay derived thereof\", which has been described as the most extreme ultramafic substrate known to host Nepenthes. Its taxonomic affinities are unclear, though it has been noted for its (apparently superficial) similarities to N. mantalingajanensis from Palawan.The specific epithet erucoides, formed from the Latin eruca (caterpillar) and Greek -oides (resembling), refers to the densely hairy developing leaves, which are said to resemble the \"exuberantly hairy caterpillars of certain erebid macromoths from\nthe subfamily Arctiinae, such as those of the genus Arctia\".\n\n\n== References =="
