    "__SUMMARY__": "Nepenthes × cincta (; from Latin cinctus \"girdled\") is a natural hybrid between N. albomarginata and N. northiana.\nN. × cincta is a rare plant and, due to the localised distribution of N. northiana, only grows at a few sites in Bau, Sarawak, usually on a substrate of limestone. N. × cincta is one of only three known natural hybrids involving N. northiana, the others being N. × bauensis and a cross with N. mirabilis.\nThe traits of N. albomarginata are very dominant in this hybrid; the wide flared peristome of its larger parent species (N. northiana) is almost completely lost. Pitchers are narrowly infundibulate (funnel-shaped) throughout and range in colouration from cream to dusky purple with red or black spots.",
