    "__SUMMARY__": "Nepenthes ephippiata (; from Latin: ephippium \"saddle cloth\"), or the saddle-leaved pitcher-plant, is a tropical pitcher plant endemic to Borneo.  It occurs in the Hose Mountains of central Sarawak, as well as Mount Raya and Bukit Lesung in Kalimantan. Non-climbing plants from the Hose Mountains appear to have less decurrent leaf attachment than specimens from Central Kalimantan, however the characteristic saddle after which the species is named is fully developed in climbing plants. Nepenthes ephippiata is closely related to N. lowii.\nB. H. Danser described the species in his 1928 monograph, \"The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies\", based only on part of a stem and an infructescence.Nepenthes ephippiata has no known natural hybrids.",
