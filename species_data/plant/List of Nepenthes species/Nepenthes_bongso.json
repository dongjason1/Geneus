    "__SUMMARY__": "Nepenthes bongso  is a tropical pitcher plant endemic to Sumatra, where it has an altitudinal distribution of 1000–2700 m above sea level. The specific epithet bongso refers to the Indonesian legend of Putri Bungsu (literally \"youngest daughter\"), the spirit guardian of Mount Marapi.The species was formally described by Pieter Willem Korthals in his 1839 monograph, \"Over het geslacht Nepenthes\".Nepenthes carunculata is considered a heterotypic synonym of N. bongso by most authorities. The infraspecific taxon Nepenthes carunculata var. robusta was described in 1994 by Joachim Nerz and Andreas Wistuba. It is an extreme variety of this taxon with a large, flared peristome.In his Carnivorous Plant Database, taxonomist Jan Schlauer treats N. junghuhnii (sensu Macfarlane) as a possible synonym of N. bongso.",
