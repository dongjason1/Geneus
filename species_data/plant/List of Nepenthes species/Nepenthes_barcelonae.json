    "__SUMMARY__": "Nepenthes barcelonae is a tropical pitcher plant native to the Philippine island of Luzon. It is known from a single mountain in the Sierra Madre range of Aurora Province, where it grows in stunted submontane forest.The specific epithet barcelonae honours Julie F. Barcelona, who discovered the species in February 2014 together with Danilo Tandang and Pieter B. Pelser.. \nNepenthes barcelonae inhabits stunted submontane forest at altitudes of 1500-1700 m a.s.l. in the Sierra Madre Mts of Luzon, Philippines. The specific type locality was not included in the species description to prevent pressures upon wild populations by hobbyists. Four species have been described from the northern Visayas and Luzon, of which two are found on Luzon; the closely allied Nepenthes ventricosa, which is widespread across the island, and Nepenthes alzapan. Under Criterion B2ab(iii) of IUCN 2014, the species is assessed informally as critically endangered by the authors - it is found from a single location, with an area of occupancy and extent of occurrence less than 10km². In addition, it is threatened by the collection of plants, and the encroachment of habitat degradation, namely slash and burn agriculture and illegal logging, which were present at lower elevations.",
