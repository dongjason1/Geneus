    "__SUMMARY__": "Nepenthes truncata (; from Latin truncatus \"terminating abruptly\") is a tropical pitcher plant endemic to the Philippines. It is known from the islands of Dinagat, Leyte, and Mindanao. The species grows at an elevation of 0–1500 m above sea level. Nepenthes truncata is characterised by its heart-shaped (truncate) leaves and very large pitchers, which can reach up to 40 cm in height.\nNepenthes robcantleyi was once considered a dark, highland form of this species.",
    "Carnivory": "On September 29, 2006, at the Botanical Gardens in Lyon, France, a Nepenthes truncata was photographed containing the decomposing corpse of a mouse.  This incident is the first record of a mammal being successfully trapped in the pitchers of N. truncata. Both N. rajah and N. rafflesiana are known to occasionally catch small mammals in the wild.\nAlthough it is possible for Nepenthes truncata to trap mice, the calcium heavy bones will not be digested.",
