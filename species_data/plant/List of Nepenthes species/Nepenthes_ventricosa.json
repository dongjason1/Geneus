    "__SUMMARY__": "Nepenthes ventricosa (; from New Latin ventricosus \"having a swelling on one side\") is a tropical pitcher plant endemic to the Philippines, where it is a highland species, growing at an elevation of 1,000–2,000 metres (3,300–6,600 ft) above sea level. It has been recorded from the islands of Luzon, Panay, and Sibuyan. The pitchers are numerous, growing up to 20 centimetres (8 in) tall and ranging in colour from ivory white to red.Nepenthes ventricosa is very closely related to both N. burkei and N. sibuyanensis, but can be distinguished by a more waisted middle to the pitchers, a smaller mouth, and, generally, a thinner peristome.",
