    "__SUMMARY__": "Psychotria loniceroides, known as the hairy psychotria, is a plant growing in forest areas of eastern Australia.\nThe habitat is the ecotone on the edge of rainforest and eucalyptus forests. It is also found in the understorey of various types of rainforests.\nThe natural range of distribution is from the Bega in south eastern New South Wales to Bamaga, in far north eastern Queensland. The scientific name refers to the healing qualities of some members of the genus Psychotria. Psyche meaning life. And loniceroides suggests the leaves are similar to the honey-suckle plant, Lonicera.",
