    "__SUMMARY__": "Durio dulcis, known as durian marangang (or merangang), red durian, tutong, or lahong, is a fairly large tree in the genus Durio. It can grow up to 40 m tall. The husk of its fruit is dark red to brown-red, and covered with slender 15–20 mm long spines. The fruit flesh is dark yellow, thin, and deep caramel-flavored, with a turpentine odor. The fruit of this species is considered by many to be the sweetest of all durians.\n\n\n== References =="
