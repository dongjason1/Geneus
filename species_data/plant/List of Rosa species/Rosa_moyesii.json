    "__SUMMARY__": "Rosa moyesii is a species of flowering plant in the rose family Rosaceae, native to western China. Growing to 4 m (13 ft) tall by 3 m (10 ft) wide, it is a vigorous deciduous shrub, with plentiful matt green leaves and flat red or pink flowers, with yellow central stamens, in summer. These are followed in autumn (fall) by prominent bottle-shaped rose-hips.\nRosa moyesii is cultivated as an ornamental shrub and has been used in rose breeding. The more compact hybrid cultivar R. moyesii 'Geranium', with brilliant orange-scarlet blooms, has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\nRosa moyesii\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References =="
