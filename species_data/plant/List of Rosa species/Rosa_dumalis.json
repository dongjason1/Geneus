    "__SUMMARY__": "Rosa dumalis, the glaucous dog rose, is a species of rose native to Europe and southwest Asia. Not all authorities accept it as distinct, with the Flora Europaea treating it as a synonym of Rosa canina.\nIt is a shrub that grows 1–2 m (3 ft 3 in–6 ft 7 in) high. It has long, bent thorns. It bears dark or light pink flowers in June and July. The hips are oval and quite soft.",
