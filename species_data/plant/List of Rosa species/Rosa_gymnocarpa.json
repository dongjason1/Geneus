    "__SUMMARY__": "Rosa gymnocarpa is a species of rose native to western North America. It is known by the common names dwarf rose, baldhip rose, and wood rose. It grows in shady, damp, and rich forests.",
    "Description": "Rosa gymnocarpa is a shrub growing up to 2 metres (6.6 ft) in height. Its stem is covered with long, straight spines which may or may not be abundant.\nThe pink or white fragrant flowers are flat and open-faced with five petals in most any shade of pink to almost lavender. Its fruit is a red rose hip containing hard tan achenes that contain the seeds. The sepals fall away from the hip earlier than in other species of rose, hence the name baldhip rose.\nThe leaves are over all, ovular in shape and are toothed on the edges.",
