    "__SUMMARY__": "Rosa hemisphaerica, also known as the sulphur rose, is a rose species with pale yellow flowers native to western Asia. The wild form, known as Rosa raphinii, has single flowers with five petals. A double-flowered form was one of the first yellow roses introduced to European gardens; John Bellenden Ker Gawler stated in 1815 that the species had been cultivated in England for nearly 200 years. The scent of the flowers has been described as unpleasant.",
