    "__SUMMARY__": "Rosa carolina, commonly known as the Carolina rose, pasture rose, or low rose, is a shrub in the rose family native to eastern North America, where it can be found in nearly all US states and Canadian provinces east of  the Great Plains.\nIt is common throughout its range and can be found in a wide variety of open habitats, from thickets and open woods to roadsides and along railroads.\nIt is a larval host of many moths and butterflies, including the variable carpet moth, the apple sphinx moth, Notocelia purpurissatana , and  Coptotriche admirabilis.",
    "Description": "\nThe stems have straight, needle-like thorns, which distinguishes it from very similar species such as R. palustris and R. virginiana, which have curved thorns. The fragrant flowers emerge in early summer and are light pink in color.\n\n\n== References =="
