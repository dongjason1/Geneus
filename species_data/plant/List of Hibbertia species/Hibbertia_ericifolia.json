    "__SUMMARY__": "Hibbertia ericifolia is a species of small perennial shrub, in the family Dilleniaceae, that is endemic to eastern Australia. It has small yellow five-petalled flowers.\nThe species was first formally described by botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1855 from a specimen collected by Gunn in Tasmania. Long considered conspecific with Hibbertia serpyllifolia after George Bentham combined the two in his Flora Australiensis, it is now recognised as distinct and is found broadly across eastern Australia.Two subspecies are recognised; subspecies ericifolia is found across Tasmania, VIctoria and into New South Wales as far as the Sydney region, predominantly inland, while subspecies acutifolia is found in coastal central New South Wales around the Sydney region.\n\n\n== References =="
