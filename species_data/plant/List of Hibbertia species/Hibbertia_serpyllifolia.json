    "__SUMMARY__": "Hibbertia serpyllifolia is a species of small perennial shrub, in the family Dilleniaceae, that is endemic to Australia. It has small yellow five-petalled flowers.\nThe species was first formally described by botanist Robert Brown, his description published in Augustin Pyramus de Candolle's Regni Vegetabilis Systema Naturale in 1817. Previously broadly defined and considered conspecific with Hibbertia ericifolia and thought to occur across eastern Australia to Tasmania, it is now recognised as only occurring in central Queensland.\n\n\n== References =="
