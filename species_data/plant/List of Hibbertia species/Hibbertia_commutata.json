    "__SUMMARY__": "Hibbertia commutata is a shrub in the Dilleniaceae family that is native to Western Australia.The shrub has an erect to sprawling habit with multiple branches and typically grows to a height of 0.1 to 0.6 m (3.9 in to 1 ft 11.6 in) but can reach as high as 1 m (3 ft 3 in). It blooms between July and November and produces yellow flowers. The plant has entire leaves and flowers that are 10 to 20 mm (0.39 to 0.79 in) across with mostly free stamens around the carpels.The species was first formally described by the botanist Ernst Gottlieb von Steudel in 1845 as part of Johann Georg Christian Lehmann's work Dilleniaceae published in Plantae Preissianae. The name is commonly misapplied to Hibbertia pilosa.\nThe species is commonly occurring throughout the South West, Peel, western parts of the Great Southern and the south western parts of the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia between Gingin in the north and  Albany in the south where it is found in a variety of habitat growing in lateritic soils.",
