    "__SUMMARY__": "Hibbertia riparia, commonly known as erect guinea-flower,  is a small shrub that is native to Australia. It grows to 60 cm high and has yellow flowers which appear in spring and summer.The species was formally described and named Pleurandra riparia by botanist Robert Brown, based on plant material collected in Tasmania. Brown's description was published in Augustin Pyramus de Candolle's Regni Vegetabilis Systema Naturale in 1817. The species was subsequently transferred to the genus Hibbertia.\nIn 2010, two new species were segregated from Hibbertia riparia: H. devitata and H. setifera.\nHibbertia riparia occurs in South Australia, Victoria, Tasmania,  New South Wales and Queensland.\n\n\n== References =="
