    "__SUMMARY__": "Hibbertia diffusa is a species of perennial shrub, in the family Dilleniaceae, endemic to the south eastern region in Australia. It has yellow five-petalled flowers. Flowering occurs from spring to autumn. This plant often appears prostrate, and may reach 30 cm in height. The habitat is open forest on the coast and nearby mountain ranges. Heathland plants on headlands by the sea are many branched with entire leaves, 4 to 5 mm long. This plant appeared in scientific literature in 1817 in the Regni Vegetabilis Systema Naturale published by the Swiss botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle.\n\n\n== References =="
