    "__SUMMARY__": "Hibbertia andrewsiana is a shrub in the Dilleniaceae family that is native to Western Australia.The shrub has an erect or spreading habit and typically grows to a height of 0.15 to 0.6 m (5.9 in to 1 ft 11.6 in). It blooms between September and January and produces yellow flowers.\nThe species was first formally described by the botanist Ludwig Diels in the 1904 work by Diels and Ernst Georg Pritzel Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae occidentalis. Beitrage zur Kenntnis der Pflanzen Westaustraliens, ihrer Verbreitung und ihrer Lebensverhaltnisse as published in Botanische Jahrbücher für Systematik, Pflanzengeschichte und Pflanzengeographie.The specific epithet honours Cecil Rollo Payton Andrews (1870 to 1951) who was a schoolteacher and later director of Education in Western Australia. He was also an avid plant collector and served as the President of the Western Australian Natural History Society.The species has a small and scattered distribution along the south coast of the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia between Ravensthorpe to just east of Esperance where it is found on rocky slopes and undulating plains growing in sandy soils.",
