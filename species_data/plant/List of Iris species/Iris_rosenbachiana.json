They all have short thick storage tubers which come to a point, and they have an extra side bulb in addition to the bulb which produces the flowers and leaves.It has lance-shaped, channelled, mid-green leaves formed from a basal tuft. The multiple leaves, grow at the same time as the short flower stem.It grows up between to 10–15 cm (4–6 in) tall.It has deeply sweet scented flowers.It has between 1-3 flowers per stem, which are long tubed and about 4–5 cm (1.5–2 in) wide.This iris is one of the first Juno irises to appear in mild winters of Washington, D.C., in the US, flowering in late February, but it can also flower in March in USDA Zone 7 gardens. In the UK, it blooms between March and April.The flowers are variable in colour, but are generally of rosy lavender with markings of darker purple and gold, but they can range from deep purple, deep rich purple, light purple, pale mauve to white.It has small down-turned rich purple standards and reddish purple falls, each with an orange, or yellow ridge or crest in the centre.It has yellow-orange pollen.This iris has a seed that has an aril.",

They like summer drought and well ventilated positions.\nIt is difficult to grow outside in the UK, so best cultivated in an alpine house or bulb frame.",
