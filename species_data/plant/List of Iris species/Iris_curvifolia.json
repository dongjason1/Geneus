Underneath, are thick fibrous secondary roots. On top of the rhizome, are the bases of last seasons leaves.It has glaucous green leaves, that are falcate (or sickle-shaped) or bent slightly above middle of the leaf. They can grow up to between 10–20 cm (4–8 in) long and 1–1.5 cm wide.

They have membranous edges and acuminate ends.The stems hold 2 terminal (top of stem) flowers, between May and June. They are held on very short pedicels.The flowers are 4.5–6 cm (2–2 in) in diameter, come in yellow, or bright yellow.It has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The falls are obovate, with brown veins, lines or stripes, and a central yellow, or pale yellow beard. They are 4.5 cm (2 in) long and 1.5 cm wide.
