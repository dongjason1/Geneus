    "__SUMMARY__": "Iris lortetii (also known as 'Lortet's Iris' or in Israel as the 'Samarian Iris'). It is sometimes incorrectly written as Iris lorteti (with one i at the end). It is a species in the genus Iris, it is also in the subgenus of Iris and in the Oncocyclus section. It has straight grey-green leaves, a 30–50 cm tall stem, with large showy flowers in late spring or mid summer, that come in shades of pink, from white, lilac, pale lavender and grey-purple. They are veined and dotted pink or maroon. It has a signal patch that is deep maroon and a sparse and brown, purple-brown or reddish beard.",
    "Description": "It is thought to resemble various other irises such as Iris sari, Iris gatesii and Iris susiana, and is thought to be perhaps the most beautiful Iris in the world.It has a short, stout rhizome, that is brown and fibrous. and They grow just under the surface of the soil and form little complex networks.It has grey-green leaves, that are straight  and sword shaped. They can grow up to between 18 and 23 cm (7 and 9 in) long, and 1–2 cm wide. They are larger or larger than those of Iris susiana, and sheath the flower stem. They are deciduous, and disappear completely during the dormancy period in winter.It has a flowering stem that is between 30 and 50 cm (12 and 19.5 in) tall.It has spathes that are 5 and 6 in (12.5 and 15 cm) long with lanceolate and pale green valves.It carries a solitary flower, that blooms in late spring, or mid summer, between April, and May.The large flowers are 7 to 9 cm (3 to 3.5 in) in diameter.The very large showy flowers are variable in colour. They can come in shades of pink, from white, to lilac., pale lavender, and grey-purple.Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals, known as the 'standards'. The falls are oblong-obovate shaped and recurved (bent backwards), with maroon, brown, or crimson, lilac to pink dots and veins on a pale blue, lavender, pale cream or yellowish ground. It has a small deep maroon coloured signal patch, and in the middle of the falls, is a row of short hairs called the 'beard', which is sparse and brown, purple-brown or reddish in colour. The paler standards are orbicular shaped, with pale lilac veins on a nearly white ground.It has a purplish-brown style with reddish brown lobes, and a 1.5 in (4 cm) long perianth tube.After the iris has flowered, it produces a seed capsule, then pollination and seed dispersal is by ants.",
    "Description-Biochemistry": "In 2006, it was found that the outer integument of I. lorteti and Iris confusa seeds contained a chemical compound, that was toxic to the germinated embryo. Blumentahal also found that the outer integument of I. lorteti and Iris confusa seeds contained a compound toxic to the germinated embryo. Also the iris seeds have a dormancy period of several months, this is due to mechanical resistance of the integument.As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes. This can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has a chromosome count of 2n=20.",
    "Taxonomy": "It is written in Hebrew as אִירוּס הָדוּר, and in Arabic as أللّغة آلعربيّة\t  سوسن جميل.It is commonly known as 'Lortet's Iris', and it also called 'Samarian Iris', although mainly in Israel.The Latin specific epithet 'lortetii' is derived from Louis Charles Émile Lortet (1836–1909) who was a French physician, botanist, zoologist and Egyptologist, he had collected the iris from the Lebanese area of the Upper Galilee, during his travels to Syria in 1880.William Barbey already described Iris lortetii but the name was validly published by Pierre Edmond Boissier in July 1882 in Fl. Orient. Vol.5 on page 131.It is sometimes incorrectly spelled as Iris lorteti, missing an i at the end of the word.I. lortetii is an tentatively accepted name by the RHS, and it is listed in the Encyclopedia of Life. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, then updated on 1 December 2004.Iris lortetii var. samariae (Dinsm.) Feinbrun is a known and accepted variant.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Iris lortetii is native to temperate Asia.",
    "Distribution and habitat-Range": "It is endemic to Israel, Palestine and southern Lebanon, (south of the Litani River) and in Syria.In Israel, it is found in the regions of Upper Galilee, Mount Gilboa, Samarian mountains and Samarian desert.",
    "Distribution and habitat-Habitat": "It grows on well drained, stony terra rossa, or rocky limestone slopes, with open shrubland and sometimes in rock crevices on limestone cliffs. It can also grow in pine forests, or Mediterranean woodlands and shrubland. It can be found at an altitude of 200–1,000 m (660–3,280 ft) above sea level.",
    "Conservation": "Within Israel, Iris lortetiiwas considered in 2002 as Endangered.The overall population size of the iris is estimated to be less than 10,000 mature individuals and the population trend is declining. Only 4 small populations are known at present. Except the Galilee populations which has been growing and expanding since the 1960s.Of the endangered populations, in particular, the variety 'samaria' from the northern West Bank is threatened by collection from the wild, meaning the uprooting of its rhizomes for commercial use, and originally it was once collected extensively for the cut flower industry and it was sold in bunches on the side of the road. Large quantities of this plant were collected in the course of the 19th century and exported to Europe, but they did not survive, as cultivated specimens rarely survive more than 2 seasons, this caused a continuous demand for fresh material (rhizomes and plants).So therefore individuals have declined by c.10% over the last ten years, and sub-populations are likely to have been lost or extinct.Other threats include rapid habitat destruction by afforestation,As the rhizomes require a hot and dry dormancy period (after flowering) and the plants are sensitive to competition and shading. Grazing by herbivorous mammals, has up to now aided survival by reducing competition from other plants. Iris populations can be threatened by Quercus calliprinos Webb (the Palestine oak) and Pinus halepensis Miller (the Aleppo pine).As the iris is protected by the Nature conservation laws in Israel, several conservation measures have been proposed to ensure the survival of the remaining populations, an iris reserve should be declared, and active pollination and reseeding under taken.As the Oncocyclus Irises are reputedly very difficult to maintain in cultivation. Much research has been carried out, especially at the Van Tubergen Nurseries, Haarlem, has developed some successful techniques. \nAlso Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael) KKL-JNF (Jewish National Fund) has carried out a study in 2012, about growing the iris from seed. Over 3,000 seeds were gathered from all the known indigenous populations, and then scientist sprouted them in greenhouse conditions. For planting them in the wild later on, in the Tel Aviv University Botanical Garden. The mature plants will be planted at the selected sites on KKL-JNF lands, over the next three years of the study. Various thinning treatments will be carried out, in order to ensure sufficient quantities of light for healthy plants.In the southern hills of Lebanon. However, heavy mining during the recent war has meant that the localities mentioned are not accessible\nand so the status of the populations of Iris westii and I. lortetii are not known.",
    "Cultivation": "I. lortetii is deemed one to be one of the most difficult irises to cultivate, in its class.\nIt is hardy to European Zone H4, and USDA Zones 2 to 9.It prefers positions in part shade to full sun, in slightly acidic soils (with a pH level between 5 and 7.5) that are a mix of sand and clay.\nLike many other irises, it should be kept moist while in growth but completely dry during dormancy (winter time), and high-nitrogen fertilizer should not be given to it.In places where it is not hardy, the plant can be stored over winter, but the rhizomes should be the stored during the late summer and autumn at 23°C, to imitate the hot, dry Mediterranean climate of their natural habitat; the rhizomes lose between 30 and 60% of their weight during storage.Aphid Dysaphis tulipae can be found on the plant.",
    "Cultivation-Propagation": "Irises can generally be propagated by division, or by seed growing.It was found that the force required to break seed coat is 133.2 MPa (Blumenthal et al., 1986).\nBlumenthal et al. (1986) found different germination rates among species, from 1% to 60% seed germination in the first year for Iris lortetii Barbey and Iris atropurpurea. Also, the pressure needed to pierce the seed coat of the two species, I. lortetii and I. atropurpurea, was 135 and 77 atmospheres, respectively.",
    "Cultivation-Hybrids and cultivars": "Iris lortetii var. samariae (Dinsm.) Feinbrun is a known variant. It was published in Fl. Palaestina 4: 121 in 1986. It has the synonym of Iris samariae Dinsm., and the common name of 'Samaria Iris', which in written in Hebrew, as איריס הדור זן שומרוני . Its description differ to Iris lortetii, in several ways such as darker standards, with brownish to purple veins on a cream coloured ground and it blooms in April. Its distribution range is found in Samaria around the city of Nablus (or Schekem) at about 800m above sea level.There is one known variety Iris lortetii 'alba' which has pure white flowers.",
    "Toxicity": "Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also handling the plant may cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction.",
    "Uses": "Soon after it was discovered in 1882, a lot of rhizomes were taken for commercial cultivation in Israel. They were exported to Europe for the ornamental plant trade. Unfortunately, the cultivated specimens rarely survived more than 2 seasons, causing a continuous demand for fresh plants and rhizomes. It was also collected extensively for the cut flower industry and was sold in bunches on the side of the road, plants were also moved to decorate the cemeteries in the area. It is still available locally, in Upper Galilee, Israel for sale as garden plants.",
    "Culture": "An illustration of Iris lortetii has been used in 1978, as a postage stamp in Israel, part of 'Protect Wild Flowers' series.",
