    "Taxonomy": "Iris zenaidae was first found by Alexei Vvedenski and he named the iris (Juno zenaidae) after Zinaida Petronava Botschantzeva (a botanist from Kazakhstan), he then published the iris in 'Opred. Rast. Sred. Azii' 2: 322 1971.Dr. Zinaida later returned the favour and named Tulipa vvedenskyi after him, in 1954.It was then thought, by several botanists including Tony Hall (from Kew Gardens) that it was a violet-blue form of Iris graeberiana. It was then listed as synonym of Iris graeberiana.In 2012, botanists F.O. Khass and Rakhimova carried out more research on the iris and others, they then re-published the iris as Iris zenaidae as a species in its own right. On 21 December 2012, it was published in 'Stapfia' (Publikation der Botanischen Arbeitsgemeinschaft am O. Ã–. Landesmuseum) 97: 178.Iris zenaidae is now an accepted name by the RHS.",
