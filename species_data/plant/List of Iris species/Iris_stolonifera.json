    "__SUMMARY__": "Iris stolonifera is a species in the genus Iris; it is also in the subgenus of Iris, and in the Regelia section. It is a rhizomatous perennial, from the mountains of Turkestan, between Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan. It has red-skinned stolon roots and rhizomes, glaucous, long, blue-grey leaves, and bi-coloured flowers, in various shades from milky white, to blue, purple, pale lilac, lavender and brown. It normally has blue to yellow beards on all the petals.",
    "Description": "It has a rhizome, that in the spring, sends out thin, and long, (up to 20 cm (8 in) long,) secondary roots (or stolons), which have a red skin. At the end of each stolon, it forms a new rhizome, creating widespread colonies of plants. Other 'Regelia section' irises also have stolons.\nAlso Iris japonica, Iris prismatica and Iris henryi produce stolons.It has dark blue-green, or glaucous leaves. They are sword-shaped, and 30–60 cm (12–24 in) long, and 0.8 cm to 2 cm wide. They are prominently veined, and semi-evergreen, disappearing after summer, after the blooming period is over.It has a stem, that can grow up to between 30–60 cm (12–24 in) tall,  or 40–60 cm (16–24 in) tall.The stem has (scarious) membranous, spathes or bracts (leaves of the flower bud), which are 6.5 cm (3 in) long.The stems hold 2–3 terminal (top of stem) flowers, blooming in late spring, between April and June, or May, or between May and June.The scented, flowers are 7–8 cm (3–3 in) in diameter.They are variable in colour, normally bi-coloured, ranging from milky white, to blue, to purple, (or pale lilac, or lavender,) and brown. \nThey normally have a blue (or pale lilac,) centre with a brown, or reddish-bronze, or yellow margin.It has two pairs of petals, three large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and three inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'.\nThe falls are 6–8 cm (2–3 in) long, and 2.5–3.5 cm (1–1 in) wide.\nThe standards are 6.5 cm (3 in) long, and 3 cm (1 in) wide.\nEach petal has a beard. Which is also variable, normally blue, or yellow, or between blue and yellow, Also lilac, and cream beards have been found.It has a brown, 2.5 cm long perianth tube, which is funnel shaped. It has 3 cm long styles, which are variable in colour. It has cream or blue coloured pollen.After the iris has flowered, between May and July, it produces an oblong seed capsule,\nthat is 6–8 cm (2–3 in) long. It is slightly inflated, and tapers at both ends. Inside the capsule, are light brown seeds that have thick white aril (coatings).",
    "Description-Biochemistry": "As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings.\nIt has a chromosome count: 2n=44.",
    "Taxonomy": "It has the common names of 'Pamiriris'.It is known as 'Pobegonosy Iris' in Russia.The Latin specific epithet stolonifera derives from its thin stolon-like roots. (See description for more details.)\nIt was first collected by Olga Fedtschenko in around 1870,It was first published and described by Karl Maximovich in the 'Bull. Acad. Imp. Sci. Saint-Pétersbourg' Vol.26 on page 535 in 1880. It was also published in 'Mélanges Biol. Bull. Phys.-Math. Acad. Imp. Sci. Saint-Pétersbourg' (Diagn. pl. nov. asiat. or 'Diagnoses Plantarum Asiaticarum') Vol. 10 on page 731 in 1880.It was also published with an illustration in Curtis's Botanical Magazine 7861 in 1902, and in Hort Vol. 7 Issue 8 page 191 on 15 April 1929.Iris stolonifera is an accepted name by the RHS, and it was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 2 October 2014.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Iris stolonifera is native to temperate areas of central Asia.",
    "Distribution and habitat-Range": "It is found in the mountain ranges of the Pamir Alai (or Alay),  (including the Gissar Range, and Saravschan Range,).\nwhich passes through the former Russian (or Soviet), country of Turkestan. (including near Bokhara,)\nIt is also found in Tajikistan, (from the city of Dushanbe, to Uzbekistan, (including near the city of Samarkand near the Baysun ridge, and in the 'Kitab Zapovednik' (Geoological) reserve in the Kashkadarya Province,) and in Afghanistan.",
    "Distribution and habitat-Habitat": "It grows on dry rock slopes, along dry creeks, and upland meadows.One reference (Flora of S.S.S.R.) mentions wet meadows and stream sides, also mentioned by the British Iris Society Guide, but herbarium specimens do not support this habitat, also the other irises in the Regelia section are also mountainside irises.\nThey can be found at an altitude of 800 to 2,400 m (2,600 to 7,900 ft) above sea level.",
    "Cultivation": "It is very cold hardy, to USDA Zone 5, or between Zone 5 to Zone 8. It is also hardy in Europe to Zone H3. In very cold areas, such as Russia, the plant may die out after 2 or 3 years.It prefers to grow in well-drained soils, which are rich in humus.\nIt can tolerate soils with a ph level of 6.8.It prefers positions in full sun.\nIt needs a dormant dry period (or drought) during the summer.The plants are not tolerant of winds.In non-hardy places, it is best grown in a bulb frame.\nIt can be also grown in rock garden.The plants should be planted at a depth of 2 inches, in October.It is thought to be one of the easiest 'Regelia' section irises to cultivate, as it is more adaptable and vigorous than others.",
    "Cultivation-Hybrids and cultivars": "Iris stolonifera has been crossed with Iris korolkowii to create different coloured hybrids that have dark brown or deep blue beards. It has been crossed with other irises but did not produce very suitable crosses.There are several different cultivars, including  'Chocolate', 'Decorated Blue Beard', 'Decorated Delight', 'Decorated Giant', 'George Barr', 'Here I Am', 'Leichtlini', 'Merlin's Magic', 'Network', 'Real Harmony', 'Red, White, And Blue', 'Conical', 'Turkish Dancer', 'Turkish Delight', 'Vaga', and 'Zwanenburg Beauty'.'Zwanenburg Beauty' has blue (or blue white ) flowers that are edged in bronze  and have bronze veins. It grows to a height of between 30 and 40 cm (12 and 16 in) tall. It has lilac shading on the falls. The beard is bronze-red  or cream-white.",
