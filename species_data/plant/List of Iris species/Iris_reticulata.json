    "__SUMMARY__": "Iris reticulata (netted iris or golden netted iris) is a species of flowering plant in the family Iridaceae. It is native to Russia, the Caucasus, and northern Iran, but cultivated widely in temperate regions. The reticulata group of irises is characterised by a fibrous net surrounding the bulb. They are small plants to 15 centimetres (5.9 in), with tubular, sharply-pointed, ribbed leaves, and flowers of yellow, blue or purple with an orange blaze on the falls, appearing in early spring. They are hardy, but prefer a well-drained sunny position in soil which dries out in summer; they are therefore suitable for a rock or gravel garden.This plant  has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\n\n== References =="
