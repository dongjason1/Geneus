    "__SUMMARY__": "Iris cathayensis is a beardless iris in the genus Iris, in the subgenus Limniris and in the Tenuifoliae series of the species. It is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial, from China. It has grey-green leaves, short stems and violet flowers.",
    "Description": "Iris cathayensis has a brown, tough, knobbly rhizome. Which has dark red leaf bases (from last seasons leaves).It has linear, greyish-green, 15–25 cm (6–10 in) long and 3 – 4 mm wide at blooming time. It later extends up to 45 cm (18 in) long and 6mm wide. The tips of the leaves arch over.It has very short flowering stems, 15–25 cm (6–10 in) long.\nSometimes, the stems do not emerge from below ground.It has between 3–4 green, lanceolate, between 12–8 cm (5–3 in) long and 2–1.2 cm (1–0 in) wide, large spathes (leaves of the flower bud).\nIt has membranous margins, visible mid-vein and pointed end.The flowers are 6–7.5 cm (2–3 in) in diameter, and come in shades of violet, in April.It has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals, known as the 'standards'.\nThe falls are narrowly oblanceolate, 4–5.5 cm (2–2 in) long and 5mm wide.\nThe standards are also narrowly oblanceolate, 4–5 cm (2–2 in) long and 5mm wide.It has a 1.5–2 cm long, filiform (thread-like) pedicel, 7–9 cm long perianth tube, 2.8–3.5 cm long stamens, blue anthers and 1.3–1.5 long ovary.\nIt also has 3.5–4 cm (1–2 in) long  and 3mm wide, linear style branches, the same colour as the petals.After the iris has flowered, it produces a seed capsule (not described)  between June and August.",
    "Description-Biochemistry": "In 2000, a chemical analysis of 22 species of iris from China was carried out. According to the distribution pattern of isoflavones in the species, they can be separated into 2 groups. One group contains  isoflavonoid aglycons and the other has glycosides and isoflavonoid aglycons. Iris cathayensis Migo and Iris mandshurica Pall. are considered intermediate groups between subgen. Limniris and Iris subg. Iris.In 2005, a study was carried out to find out the chemical composition of Iris cathayensis. Using chromatography and spectroscopic methods, as well as others.",
    "Taxonomy": "It is written as 华夏鸢尾 in Chinese script and known as hua xia yuan wei in China.It has the common name of 'China Iris', or Cathay Iris.The Latin specific epithet cathayensis refers to Cathay, the Anglicized version of \"Catai\" and an alternative name for China.\nIt was published and described by Hisao Migo, in the 'Journal of the Shanghai Science Institute' Sect.3 Vol.4 on page 140 in 1939.It was later published in 'Flora of Jiangsu', First Vol. 395, Fig. 712 in 1977.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Iris cathayensis is native to temperate areas of Asia.",
    "Distribution and habitat-Range": "It is found in the Chinese provinces of Anhui, Jiangsu, Hubei, and Zhejiang.",
    "Distribution and habitat-Habitat": "It is found growing on open hillsides and grasslands, and low-altitude mountain meadow slopes.",
    "Cultivation": "Iris cathayensis is not common in cultivation in the UK.It prefers to grow in sandy soils. It needs to be kept dry during winter, needing the protection of bulb frames, it only needs water during the growing season.",
