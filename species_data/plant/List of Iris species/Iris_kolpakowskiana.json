They are 0.2 cm wide and ribbed on the underside.It has a very short stem, green spathes (leaves of the flower bud) and perianth tube 5–9 cm (2.0–3.5 in) long.It blooms in late winter, between March, and April.The flowers are bi-tone (2 coloured), they come in purple shades, from reddish-violet, lilac-violet, pale lilac to pale purple.Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'.

    "Description-Biochemistry": "As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It was counted as 2n=20.",
