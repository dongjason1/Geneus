    "__SUMMARY__": "Banksia littoralis, commonly known as the swamp banksia, swamp oak, pungura and the western swamp banksia, is a tree in the plant genus Banksia. It is found in south west Western Australia from the south eastern metropolitan area of Perth (31°6′S ) to the Stirling Range (approximately 34 ° S) and Albany (35 ° S). It is often mistaken for the River Banksia (Banksia seminuda), as they share many similar characteristics.",
    "Description": "It grows up to 20 metres tall with a gnarled trunk covered with a crumbly grey rough bark. Flowering occurs between late summer and late winter. Often partly hidden by foliage, the yellow flower spikes grow up to 200 mm long by 70 mm wide and contain in excess of 1000 individual flowers. The fruiting cones can remain on the trees for many years after shedding the flowers early. Leaves are between 100 mm and 200 mm with increasing teeth tips towards the end.",
    "Habitat": "It grows in high moisture peat like sand of depressions and swamps, common in coastal woodlands and heath.",
    "Taxonomy": "Banksia littoralis appears most closely related to the other species of the series Spicigerae such as B. seminuda and B. occidentalis.",
    "Cultivation": "Banksia littoralis has proven relatively easy to grow in cultivation. It is possibly not as sensitive to dieback as other western banksias. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 20 to 36 days to germinate.",
