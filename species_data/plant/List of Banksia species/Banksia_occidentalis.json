    "__SUMMARY__": "The red swamp banksia or waterbush (Banksia occidentalis) is a species of shrub or small tree in the plant genus Banksia. It occurs on the south coast of Western Australia in three disjunct populations: at Augusta, around Albany and in the Esperance area.\nA 1980 field study at Cheyne beach showed it to be pollinated by the New Holland honeyeater and white-cheeked honeyeater.Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 21 to 47 days to germinate.The species was observed to be in cultivation in England in the gardens of Chiswick House in 1834.",
