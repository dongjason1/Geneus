    "__SUMMARY__": "The western mountain banksia or mountain banksia (Banksia oreophila) is a species of shrub in the plant genus Banksia. It occurs on the slopes and hilltops of the Stirling and Barren Ranges in southwest Western Australia.",
    "Taxonomy": "It was first described by Ferdinand von Mueller in 1869 as Banksia quercifolia var. integrifolia. In 1981, Alex George promoted it to species rank. However, as there was already a plant named Banksia integrifolia (coast banksia), he had to choose a new name.",
    "Cultivation": "Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 23 to 27 days to germinate.",
