    "__SUMMARY__": "Banksia vincentia is a shrub that grows in a small location in southern New South Wales. It belongs to the Banksia spinulosa species complex and has affinities to Banksia neoanglica, found several hundred kilometres to the north.Banksia vincentia grows as a squat, spreading shrub 30–75 cm high by 1–2 m wide, with branches growing horizontally for 20–30 cm before veering upwards.Banksia vincentia was described by Marge Stimpson and Peter Weston in 2014, having been initially discovered in 2008. Local nursery owner Jacki Koppman came across the plant and suspected it was a distinct species, sending material to the New South Wales Herbarium for assessment and identification.Banksia vincentia is known from a single population of plants—14 at time of discovery and now down to 12 individual shrubs.Conservation has involved storing and germinating seed as well as cultivating new plants from cuttings at the Australian Botanic Gardens in Canberra, and Wollongong Botanic Gardens. Material has been sent to the Kew Royal Botanic Gardens in England as well.\n\n\n== References =="
