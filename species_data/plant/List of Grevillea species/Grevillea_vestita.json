In 1845 Carl Meissner put the species into the genus Grevillea. The specific epithet is vestita from the Latin word vestitus meaning \"covered in hairs\"\nThere are currently two recognised subspecies:\n\nGrevillea vestita (Endl.) Meisn. subsp. vestita\nGrevillea vestita subsp.isopogoides F.Muell. ex McGill. which has smaller leaves with the margins rolled under.Two former varieties are now regarded as separate species\n\nGrevillea vestita var. angustata Meisn. is now Grevillea curviloba McGill. subsp. curviloba\nGrevillea vestita var. stenogyne Benth. is now  Grevillea stenogyne (Benth.) Makinson",
