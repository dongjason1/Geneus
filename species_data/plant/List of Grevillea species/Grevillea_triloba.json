    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea triloba is a spreading shrub endemic to Western Australia, principally the Geraldton area. Its height usually ranges between 0.9 and 1.5 metres high. The flowers, which are sweet-scented, are usually white but pink flowering forms have been observed within the natural distribution. These are produced from early winter to mid spring (June to October In Australia). Its narrow leaves are three-lobed (hence the specific name triloba) and each of the lobes terminates in a sharp point.\n\n\n== References =="
