    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea petrophiloides (pink pokers) is a shrub grevillea native to Western Australia. It is 1 to 3 metres high, with thin, needle-like leaves and dense, cylindrical flowers. Grevillea petrophiloides occurs in sandy and rocky areas. The fruits are sticky follicles, 5 to 7 centimetres long.\nThe specific name \"petrophiloides\" comes from the similar appearance of the leaves with the genus Petrophile.",
