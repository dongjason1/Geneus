    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered grevillea, is a shrub of the genus Grevillea native to an area along the south coast in the Great Southern and Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia.The erect and straggly shrub typically grows to a height of 0.7 to 2 metres (2 to 7 ft) and has non-glaucous branchlets. It has simple undissected flat linear to narrowly obovate leaves with a blade that is 55 to 70 millimetres (2.2 to 2.8 in) long and 1.5 to 7 millimetres (0.1 to 0.3 in) wide. It blooms from July to December and produces an axillary or terminal raceme very irregular inflorescence with red flowers and red styles. Later it forms wrinkled, ellipsoidal and glabrous fruit that is 10 to 16 mm (0.4 to 0.6 in) long.\nThe specific epithet pauciflora, referring the Latin term for 'few flowered'.There are two recognised subspecies:\n\nGrevillea pauciflora subsp. leptophylla\nGrevillea pauciflora subsp. pauciflora",
