    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea pythara, also known as the Pythara grevillea, is a shrub of the genus Grevillea native to a small area in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia.The suckering shrub typically grows to a height of 0.06 to 0.3 metres (0.2 to 1.0 ft) and has non-glaucous branchlets. It has simple linear undissected flat leaves with a blade that is 7 to 16 millimetres (0.28 to 0.63 in) long and 1.5 to 4 mm (0.06 to 0.16 in) wide. The leaves are grey-green in colour and covered in fine hairs. It blooms from May to October and produces a terminal raceme irregular inflorescence with red or blue flowers and red styles.\nIt is only found near Dalwallinu growing amongst medium or low trees in sandy soils. Only a single population of the plant is known that is found in a patch of remnant vegetation on degraded road reserve.\nGrevillea pythara was discovered by, Jan Wellburn, the daughter of a nearby landowner. It was declared rare in 1994 and critically endangered in 1995. Threats to the species include severe weed infestation, being trampled by stock, increasing soil salinity and road maintenance.",
