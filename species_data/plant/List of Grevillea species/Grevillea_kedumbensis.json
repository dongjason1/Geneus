    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea kedumbensis is a shrub which is endemic to a restricted locale in the Great Dividing Range in central New South Wales in Australia.First collected by Alec Blombery in 1986, Grevillea kedumbensis was described by Don McGillivray as a subspecies of Grevillea obtusiflora in 1986. Peter Olde and Neil Marriott raised it to species rank in 1994. They reported that the similarities in form of the plants with the Picton form of Grevillea mucronulata suggests as close a relationship with that species as with G. obtusiflora.Grevillea kedumbensis grows as a low shrub 20 to 1 m (787 to 39 in) high with a woody base known as a lignotuber. The narrow-elliptic to obovate leaves are 1–3 (0.4-1.2 in) cm long and 0.1–0.5 cm wide with entire margins. The flower heads, known as inflorescences, are made up of 12 to 20 individual flowers, and appear mainly in winter and spring, though can occur at any time of year. The perianths are cream, the styles brown-red and the pollen presenters are green.\n\n\n== References =="
