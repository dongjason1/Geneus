    "Cultivation": "Grevillea lavandulacea is cultivated as an ornamental plant, for use in well draining and drought tolerant gardens.\nA number of naturally occurring forms have been introduced into cultivation from localities including Adelaide Hills, Black Range, Flinders Ranges, Little Desert, Mount Compass, Penola, Victor Harbor and Woakwine. The commonly grown cultivar G. lavendulacea 'Tanunda' is thought to have originated from Aldinga in South Australia, rather than Tanunda in the Barossa Valley where a different form occurs.\n\n\n== References =="
