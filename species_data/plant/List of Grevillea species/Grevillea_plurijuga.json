    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea plurijuga is a shrub native to the southern Western Australia. Grevillea plurijuga has two subspecies (plurijuga and superba), both common within the Esperance region with subsp. plurijuga mainly occurring to the northeast in the drier mallee that typically has a fine sand/clay soil over limestone but can also be found on clay and gravel. In its habitat it is often low and sprawling, or sometimes a more upright shrub to 2 metres (over 6 feet) in height. The flowers are around 4 cm overall (1 1/2 inches) and are site on a leafless recurred flowering stem, so they are below the overall height of a shrub or trail near the ground. It is this feature along with more narrow leaf segments that distinguish it from subsp. superba.\n\n\n== References =="
