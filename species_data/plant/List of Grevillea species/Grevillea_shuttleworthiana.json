    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea shuttleworthiana is a shrub of the genus Grevillea native to an area in the Wheatbelt and Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia.The shrub typically grows to a height of 0.5 to 3 metres (1.6 to 9.8 ft) and has non-glaucous branchlets. It has simple, flat, obovate and undissected leaves with a blade that is 8 to 55 millimetres (0.31 to 2.17 in) long and 5 to 27 mm (0.20 to 1.06 in) wide. It blooms from July to September and produces an axillary or terminal raceme regular inflorescence with yellow flowers and yellow styles. Later it forms smooth or rugose obovoid glabrous fruit that is 7 to 17 mm (0.3 to 0.7 in) long.It is similar to Grevillea integrifolia but has ridged branchlets.Grevillea shuttleworthiana is found from Kalbarri in the north and as far south as Ravensthorpe. It extends west from the sandplains of Perth as far east as Mount Jackson near Southern Cross. It grows in shrubland or heathland amongst medium to low trees in gravelly, sandy or clay soils.There are three recognised subspecies:\n\nGrevillea shuttleworthiana subsp. canarina\nGrevillea shuttleworthiana subsp. obovata\nGrevillea shuttleworthiana subsp. shuttleworthiana",
