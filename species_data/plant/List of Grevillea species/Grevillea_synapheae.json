It is closely related to Grevillea trifida, Grevillea muelleri and Grevillea prominens.Several subspecies have been identified as follows:\nG. synapheae subsp. Mt Misery (S.D.Hopper 6333), also known as \"Mt Misery form\"\nG. synapheae subsp. latiloba (Meisn.) Makinson, also known as the \"Mogumber\" or \"broad-leaved\" form\nG. synapheae subsp. minyulo Makinson, also known as \"Minyollo form\" or \"Minyollo variant\"\nG. synapheae R.Br. subsp. synapheae\n\n\n== References =="
