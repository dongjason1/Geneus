    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea stenobotrya is a shrub in the family Proteaceae. It is endemic to arid regions of Australia. Common names include  rattle-pod grevillea, sandhill grevillea and sandhill spider flower. Plants grow to between 1.5 and 6 metres in height and have leaves are linear and entire, or occasionally divided, and between 6 and 28 cm long and 0.7 to 2.5 mm wide. Flowers are cream, pale yellow or pale pink. These appear in clustered spikes at the end of branches between May and December in the species' native range. The fruits which follow are hard, flattened and rounded and have a short beak.The species was formally described in 1875 by Victorian Government Botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in the ninth volume of his Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae. Mueller's description was based on plant material collected in the MacDonnell Ranges in central Australia during an expedition by Ernest Giles. The specific epithet is derived from the Greek words  stenos (narrow)  and botrys (bunch of grapes). It occurs in red sandhill country in association with other shrub and Triodia species.",
