    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea brevifolia, commonly known as Cobberas grevillea, is a species of the plant genus Grevillea.  It is native to the states of Victoria and New South Wales  in Australia. The red flowers appear between November and December in the species' native range. The species was first formally described by Victorian Government Botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1879 in Flora Australiensis, based on a collection from Mount Tambo in Victoria. The former subspecies G. brevifolia subsp. polychroma was elevated to species status as Grevillea polychroma in 2005. Grevillea brevifolia is listed as  \"Rare in Victoria\" in the Department of Environment and Primary Industries' Advisory List of Rare Or Threatened Plants In Victoria. The species occurs in sub-alpine areas including the Pilot Wilderness, the Cobberas-Tingaringy Unit of the Alpine National Park, and Mount Seldom Seen.",
