    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea celata, the Nowa Nowa grevillea or Colquhoun grevillea, is a shrub which is endemic to  Victoria, Australia. It is closely related to Grevillea alpina and Grevillea chrysophaea.\nIt  grows  to between 0.4 and 1.8 metres in height. The undivided leaves are tomentose underneath and are 20 to 45 mm long and 4 to 18 mm wide. The leaf margins are recurved, sometimes to the extent of being near-revolute. Flowers appear between  July and February (mid winter to late summer) in its native range. These have perianths which are red at the base and yellow at the top, or alternatively red/white, apricot/white or occasionally all yellow. The styles are green at the base, becoming pink or red towards the tip, with the tip itself being green. Occasionally these are completely light green in colour.\nThe species was first formally described by Bill Molyneux in Muelleria in 1995.Grevillea celata occurs in dry, sclerophyll  woodland in Colquhoun State Forest in south-eastern Victoria.The species is listed as \"Vulnerable\" under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, \"threatened\" in Victoria under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 and \"Vulnerable in Victoria\" on the Department of Sustainability and Environment's Advisory List of Rare Or Threatened Plants In Victoria.\n\n\n== References =="
