These are followed by ovoid fruits, about 14 mm long.Grevillea infundibularis occurs in heathland, growing among small to medium trees. In Western Australia, the species is listed as Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora — Extant) under the Wildlife Conservation Act.The species was first formally described in 1974 by botanist Alex George in the journal Nuytsia.\nThe specific epithet infundibularis is derived from the Latin name for funnel, referring to the shape of the leaves.\n\n\n== References =="
