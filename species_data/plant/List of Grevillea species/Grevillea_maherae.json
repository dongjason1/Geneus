It has flat undissected trullate leaves with a blade that is 40 to 65 millimetres (2 to 3 in) in length and 25 to 35 mm (0.98 to 1.38 in) wide. It blooms from December to March and produces a terminal raceme irregular inflorescence with red, purple or pink flowers. Later it forms ellipsoidal simple hairy fruit that is 11 to 19 mm (0.4 to 0.7 in).Grevillea maherae is able to regenerate from both seed, lignotuber and rhizome.It is found in tall and low shrubland and Eucalyptus miniata woodland on Mount Elizabeth Station.
