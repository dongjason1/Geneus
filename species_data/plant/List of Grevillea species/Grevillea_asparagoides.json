    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea asparagoides is a shrub which is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It  grows up from 0.5 to 2 metres in height and produces bright red  flowers between July and December (late winter  to early summer) in its native range.The species was first formally described by botanist Carl Meissner; his description was published in Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis in 1856. The specific epithet is derived from a passing resemblance of the foliage to that of asparagus.The current status of the plant in its natural setting is poorly described and its range of occurrence might be further than found on databases.",
    "Cultivation": "This species requires a well-drained soil and full sun. Propagation is from cuttings; grafting on the east coast of Australia may be required to ensure greater reliability.",
