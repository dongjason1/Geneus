It usually  grows to 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in) in height and width, and produces brilliant red  flowers, which later blacken, between July and December (late winter to early summer) in its native range.The species was first formally described by botanist Allan Cunningham, his description published in Thomas Braidwood Wilson's Narrative of a Voyage Round the World in 1835. The specific epithet honours Wilson.",
