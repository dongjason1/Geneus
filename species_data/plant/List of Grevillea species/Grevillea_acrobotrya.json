White or cream flowers appear in racemes throughout the year.\nThe species was first formally described by Swiss botanist Carl Meissner  in Hooker's Journal of Botany and Kew Garden Miscellany in 1855,  based on plant material collected by James Drummond from the hinterland north of the Swan River.\nIt occurs among low to medium-sized trees in heathland.",
