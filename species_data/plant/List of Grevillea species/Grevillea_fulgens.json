    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea fulgens is a shrub of the genus Grevillea native to a small area along the south coast in the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia.The spreading straggly shrub typically grows to a height of 0.5 to 3 metres (2 to 10 ft) and has non-glaucous branchlets. It has simple undissected flat elliptic to linear leaves with a blade that is 30 to 110 millimetres (1 to 4 in) in length and 1 to 7 mm (0.04 to 0.28 in) wide. It blooms from June to October and produces a terminal raceme irregular inflorescence with red or pink flowers. Later it forms an ovoid glabrous fruit that is 12 to 15 mm (0.47 to 0.59 in).It is non-lignotuberous and regenerates from seed.Grevillea fulgens grows in shrubland or mallee heath in shallow gravelly soil on laterite, it is found in an area near Ravensthorpe between Mount Short to Mount Desmond within the Fitzgerald Biosphere region. It is known to be a disturbance opportunist in the gravel soils of the Ravensthorpe Range.",
