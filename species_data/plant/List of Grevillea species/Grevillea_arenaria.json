    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea arenaria is a shrub which is endemic to the east of New South Wales in Australia. It has an erect to spreading habit and grows to between 1 and 3 metres in height. Its leaves are 1.5 to 7 cm long and 3 to 15 mm in width. The flowers, which occur in groups of 2 to 10,  are pink, red or orange, with green or yellow at the base and green styles. These occur year-round, with a major flourish in spring.\nThe species was first formally described by botanist Robert Brown in  Transactions of the Linnean Society of London in 1810.\nThere are currently two recognised subspecies:\n\nG. arenaria R.Br. subsp. arenaria\nG. arenaria subsp. canescens (R.Br.) Olde & MarriottA former subspecies, known as G. arenaria  subsp. montana (R.Br.) McGill., is currently treated as a species in its own right - \nG. montana R.Br.\nIt occurs on sandy soils in open forests in the Great Dividing Range, its southernmost extent in line with Narooma and its northernmost extent in line with Sydney.",
