    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea tenuiflora, commonly known as the tassel grevillea, is a shrub of the genus Grevillea native to an area in the Wheatbelt and South West regions of Western Australia.The spreading shrub typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 metres (3.3 to 4.9 ft) and has non-glaucous branchlets. It has simple and dissected leaves with a blade that is 17 to 55 millimetres (0.67 to 2.17 in). It blooms between August and September and produces an axillary or terminal raceme irregular inflorescence with purple or white flowers and white or purple styles. Later it forms tuberculate ovoid glandular hairy fruit that are 9 to 11 mm (0.4 to 0.4 in) long. It regenerates from seed and is closely related and similar to Grevillea pulchella.G. tenuiflora is found in heath, woodland or shrubland from Armadale as far east as Wagin. It grows in gravelly, sand or clay soils over laterite.",
