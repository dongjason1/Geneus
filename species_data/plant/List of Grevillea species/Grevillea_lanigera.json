    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea lanigera, commonly known as woolly grevillea,  is  a small shrub   which is endemic to Victoria and New South Wales in Australia.",
    "Description": "The species shows considerable variation in its habit and other characteristics. It may be prostrate or erect, the latter forms growing from 0.3 to 1.5 metres in height. The red flowers may occur throughout the year, but are most prolific in winter and spring. It has hairy leaves and branchlets, giving rise to the specific epithet lanigera derived from the Latin words lana (wool) and ger (to bear or carry).",
