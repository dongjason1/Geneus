    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea leptopoda is a flowering plant originally found in Western Australia, mostly near Geraldton.\nThe spreading to erect shrub typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 metres (3.3 to 4.9 ft) and has non-glaucous branchlets. It has dissected leaves with a blade that is 30 to 80 millimetres (1.2 to 3.1 in). It blooms between August and November and produces a terminal raceme irregular inflorescence with white, pink or cream flowers with white styles. Later it forms rugose ellipsoidal fruit that are 9 to 11 mm (0.4 to 0.4 in) long. It regenerates from seed only.It can be confused with Grevillea teretifolia which has a shorter floral rachis and longer pistils.\nGrevillea leptopoda is found in the Mid West and the Wheatbelt regions from Kalbarri south to Moora growing among medium to low trees in tall shrubland, mallee or heathland It will grow in rocky, stony or sandy lateritic soils.The plant was first described by the botanist Donald McGillivray in 1986 in New Names Grevillea journal. It has a West Australian Flora Conservation Code of P3, which means it is poorly known.\nGrevillea leptopoda has heavily scented flowers and is used in domestic gardens in warmer areas.",
