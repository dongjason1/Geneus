    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea fistulosa, commonly known as the Barrens grevillea or the Mount Barren Grevillea, is a shrub of the genus Grevillea native to a small area along the south coast in the Great Southern and Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia.The erect shrub typically grows to a height of 0.6 to 2 metres (2 to 7 ft) and has non-glaucous branchlets. It has simple undissected flat elliptic to linear leaves with a blade that is 40 to 90 millimetres (2 to 4 in) in length and 3 to 15 mm (0.12 to 0.59 in) wide. It blooms from July to December and produces a terminal raceme irregular inflorescence with red or orange flowers.\nIt will produce a ribbed or ridged ovoid hairy fruit 12 to 18 mm (0.47 to 0.71 in) long and is only able to regenerate from seed.Grevillea fistulosa is found amongst the medium trees or tall shrubland and heath in rocky or stony, particularly quartzite and granitic soils. It is found in the Fitzgerald IBRA sub-region mostly on or around the Barren and Whoogarup Range in the Fitzgerald River National Park.",
