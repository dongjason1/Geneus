    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea drummondii, or Drummond's grevillea, is a shrub which is endemic to the south west region of Western Australia.\nIt  grows to between 0.2 and 1 metre in height and produces flowers between June and December (early winter to early summer) in its native range. These are cream in bud, ageing to pink or red. The leaves are narrow-elliptic to narrow-obovate and are 1 to 3 cm long and 1.5 to 3 mm wide.The species was first formally described by botanist  Carl Meissner, his description published in Plantae Preissianae in 1845. Grevillea pimeleoides and G. centristigma are closely related and were formerly treated as subspecies. Grevillea drummondii is classified as Priority Four Flora (Rare) under the Wildlife Conservation Act in Western Australia.\n\n\n== References =="
