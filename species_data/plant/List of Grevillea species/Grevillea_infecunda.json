    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea infecunda, commonly known as Anglesea grevillea,  is a root-suckering shrub which is endemic to  Victoria, Australia.  It  grows  to 0.3 to 1.2 metres in height. The flowers are yellowish-green, ageing to orange-red.  These appear between  October and December (mid spring to early summer) in its native range.The species was first formally described by Donald McGillivray in New Names in Grevillea (Proteaceae) in 1986.Grevillea infecunda occurs in undulating terrain in Anglesea and Aireys Inlet. Two preserved plant specimens were collected by Ferdinand von Mueller in 1852 from Brighton and confirmed as this species by Donald McGillivray in the 1980s; the area is now suburbia.The species is listed as \"Vulnerable\" under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, \"threatened\" in Victoria under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 and \"Vulnerable in Victoria\" on the Department of Sustainability and Environment's Advisory List of Rare Or Threatened Plants In Victoria.\n\n\n== References =="
