    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea eriobotrya, commonly called the woolly cluster grevillea, is a shrub of the genus Grevillea native to a small area in the Mid West, Wheatbelt and Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia.The erect shrub typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 4 metres (5 to 13 ft) and has non-glaucous branchlets. It has simple flat linear leaves with a blade that is 70 to 140 millimetres (3 to 6 in) in length and 1 to 1.5 mm (0.04 to 0.06 in) wide. It blooms from September to December and produces a terminal inflorescence with white to cream flowers, followed by a simple hairy ellipsoidal fruit that is 20 to 25 mm (0.8 to 1.0 in) long. The plant has a lightweight subhemispherical seed with a spongy testa, most likely adapted for wind-dispersal, it can be regenerated from seed only.Grevillea eriobotrya grows on sandplains amongst tall or medium trees in sandy soils in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie and Yalgoo IBRA regions.",
