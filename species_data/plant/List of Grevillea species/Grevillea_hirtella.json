    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea hirtella is a shrub of the genus Grevillea native to a small area along the west coast in the Mid West region of Western Australia.The spreading shrub typically grows to a height of 0.3 to 0.9 metres (1 to 3 ft) and has non-glaucous terete branchlets. It has simple flat linear tripartite dark green leaves that are usually crowded with a blade that is 5 to 20 millimetres (0.20 to 0.79 in) in length and 0.5 to 1 mm (0.02 to 0.04 in) wide. It blooms from August to October and produces a terminal raceme irregular inflorescence with red to pink flowers. Later it forms an oblong or ellipsoidal ridged or ribbed glabrous fruit that is 12 to 13 mm (0.5 to 0.5 in).It is believed to only regenerate from seed.Grevillea hirtella appears in areas of open heathland and amongst medium or low trees as scattered populations between Mingenew and Walkaway. It grows in sandy or loamy soils.It is sold as a hardy evergreen shrub that can be used for edging, a groundcover or as a border. G. hirtella can tolerate full sun and light frost.Grevillea hirtella is one of a number of former subspecies of Grevillea thelemanniana are now regarded as species in their own right.",
