    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea glauca, commonly known as bushman's clothes peg, cobblers peg tree or the beefwood tree, is a shrub or small tree that is native to Papua New Guinea and north-eastern Queensland, Australia. It usually grows to a height of between 2 and 10 metres and has leaves that are 6 to 20 cm long and 1 to 6.5 cm wide. Flowers are cream or greenish white and appear between April and August in the species' native range. These are followed by rounded follicles that are 2.4 to 4 cm long.The species was formally described in 1809 based on plant material collected by botanists Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander near the Endeavour River during Lieutenant James Cook's first voyage of discovery in 1770.",
