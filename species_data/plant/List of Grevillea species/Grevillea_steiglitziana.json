    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea steiglitziana, also known as Brisbane Ranges grevillea, is a spreading shrub which is endemic to  Victoria, Australia. It  grows  to between 0.7 and 2 metres in height . The flowers, which are greenish-brown with red styles, appear between  September and January  (early spring to mid summer) in its native range.\nThe species was first formally described by Norman Wakefield in Victorian Naturalist in 1956.\nGrevillea steiglitziana occurs in dry sclerophyll forest in the Brisbane Ranges. It is named after the town of Steiglitz, Victoria. At Brisbane Ranges National Park west of Melbourne, which was invaded by Phytophthora cinnamomi in the 1970s, Grevillea steiglitziana (along with such species as Banksia marginata) was part of a secondary regrowth of understory species after more resistant shrubs such as grasses and sedges had grown back.The species is listed as  \"Rare in Victoria\" on the Department of Sustainability and Environment's Advisory List of Rare Or Threatened Plants In Victoria.",
