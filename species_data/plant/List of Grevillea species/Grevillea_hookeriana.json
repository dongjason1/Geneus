    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea hookeriana (red toothbrushes or Hooker's grevillea) is a shrub species in the family Proteaceae. It is endemic to the south west region of Western Australia.It  usually grows to between 0.5 and 2.5 metres in height and 4 metres wide. Yellow, red or black  \"toothbrush\" flowers are produced between May and November.The species was formally described by botanist Carl Meissner in Plantae Preissianae in 1845.The Latin specific epithet hookeriana refers  to Sir Joseph D. Hooker.Three subspecies are currently recognised:\n\nG. hookeriana subsp. apiciloba (F.Muell.) Makinson\nG. hookeriana subsp. digitata (F.Muell.) Makinson\nG. hookeriana Meisn. subsp. hookeriana",
    "Cultivation": "A cultivar known as  G.'Red Hooks' (often erroneously referred to as G. hookeriana or G. hookerana) has been in cultivation for many years. It is a hybrid of G. hookeriana and G. tetragonoloba.G. hookeriana is comparatively rare in cultivation, and less vigorous than the cultivar. It is best suited to a climate where the summers are dry.\nIt requires good drainage and prefers a sunny or partially shaded position and has moderate frost resistance. Propagation is from semi-mature cuttings or seed.",
