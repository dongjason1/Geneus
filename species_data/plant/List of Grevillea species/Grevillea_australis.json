    "__SUMMARY__": "The Grevillea australis, commonly known as the Southern grevillea, is the only Grevillea to occur naturally in Tasmania, but also grows in highland areas of south-eastern mainland Australia. It has several variations in the wild, and is therefore a very variable species.\nIt grows between 0.2 metres to 2.5 metres high and has oval shaped leaves, 15 to 30 mm long by 1 to 5 mm wide. It has white flowers and seeds in brown, leathery follicles.\nGrevillea australis grows best in cool to cold climates.  Ideally it grows in well-lit conditions with well-drained soil.",
