    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea candelabroides is a shrub or small tree which is endemic to sandy heathland between Geraldton and Shark Bay in Western Australia.\nThe spectacular but unpleasantly-scented flower spikes appear predominantly in the spring and summer. These are white, upright, tall and appear in clusters (hence the specific name candelabroides). The shrub can grow up to 4 metres in both height and width.",
