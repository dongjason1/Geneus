    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea latifolia is a shrub of the genus Grevillea native to an area in the Kimberley region of Western Australia.The lignotuberous shrub typically grows to a height of 0.6 to 2.5 metres (2 to 8 ft) and has non-glaucous branchlets. It has flat undissected orbiticular leaves with a blade that is 70 to 160 millimetres (3 to 6 in) in length and 70 to 135 mm (2.76 to 5.31 in) wide. It blooms from March to September and produces a terminal raceme irregular inflorescence with red or pink flowers. Later it forms an elliptic glabrous fruit that is 16 to 19 mm (0.6 to 0.7 in).Grevillea latifolia is able to regenerate from both seed and lignotuber.It is found amongst medium to low trees in woodlands or grasslands in scattered populations on the Mitchell and Gardner Plateaus, the King Edward and Lawley Rivers and almost to Wyndham in the east. The shrub grows in sandy or loamy soils on sandstone, quartzite or laterite.",
