    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea inconspicua, commonly known as the Cue grevillea, is a shrub of the genus Grevillea native to an area in the Mid West and Goldfields regions of Western Australia.The intricately branched, dense, prickly and spreading shrub typically grows to a height of 0.6 to 2 metres (2 to 7 ft) which has wiry, non-glaucous, subterete branchlets. It has simple flat leaves with a blade that is 10 to 45 millimetres (0.39 to 1.77 in) in length and 0.5 to 1.5 mm (0.02 to 0.06 in) wide. It blooms from June to August and produces a terminal raceme irregular inflorescence with white or grey flowers. Later it forms an ovoid or ellipsoidal ridged or ribbed glabrous fruit that is 8 to 14 mm (0.3 to 0.6 in).\nIt occurs in the central western area of Western Australia in several locales including, Cue, Meekatharra and north east of Sandstone. G. inconspicua is found in sparse or open shrub communities often along drainage lines and gullies. It grows well in red clay and loam over green stone.The shrub is suitable for use in a water wise garden, although it is not showy, it can take full sun and well drained soils are recommended.",
