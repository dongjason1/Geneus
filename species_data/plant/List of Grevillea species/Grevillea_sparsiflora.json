    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse flowered grevillea, is a shrub of the genus Grevillea native to an area along the south coast in the Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia.The shrub typically grows to a height of 0.3 to 1.5 metres (1.0 to 4.9 ft) and has non-glaucous branchlets. It has simple, flat, terete and undissected leaves with a blade that is 10 to 60 millimetres (0.39 to 2.36 in) long and 1 to 2 mm (0.04 to 0.08 in) wide. It blooms from July to September and produces an axillary raceme irregular inflorescence with red or pink flowers and orange or pink styles. Later it forms wrinkled ellipsoidal glabrous fruit that is 13 to 16 mm (0.5 to 0.6 in) long. It is similar to Grevillea decipiens which has 7–9 longitudinal ridges on the upper leaf surface and a densely brown-silky outer perianth surface which is white of G. sparsifolia. Grevillea pauciflora is also similar, but has a different style.\nGrevillea sparsiflora is found between Mount Ragged, to the east of Esperance and has a range that extends as far east as Twilight Cove. It grows on sand dunes, limestone cliffs and in Eucalypt woodlands in sandy and loamy soils.",
