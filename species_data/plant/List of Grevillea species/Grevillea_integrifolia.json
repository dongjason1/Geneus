    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea integrifolia, commonly known as entire-leaved grevillea, is a shrub that is endemic to the south west of Western Australia.It  usually grows to between 0.6 and 2.5 metres in height and produces flowers between September and January (early spring to mid summer) in its native range. These have a white, cream or pale yellow perianth and a white to cream coloured style.The species was first formally described in Stirpium Australasicarum Herbarii Hugeliani Decades Tres in 1830 by Austrian botanist Stephan Endlicher who gave it the name Anadenia integrifolia. The species was transferred to the genus Grevillea by Swiss botanist Carl Meissner in 1856.\n\n\n== References =="
