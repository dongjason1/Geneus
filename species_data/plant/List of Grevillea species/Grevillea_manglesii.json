    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea manglesii is a shrub which is endemic to an area around Perth in Western Australia. It  usually grows to around 3 metres in height and 4 metres in width and produces  white flowers throughout the year.The species was first formally described by Robert Graham, his description published in the Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal in 1839. Graham described the species based on a plant which had been sent to the Botanic Garden Edinburgh by the Clapton Nursery in London with the unpublished name Grevillea manglesii. Graham gave it the name Anadenia manglesii. In 1858 French botanist Jules Émile Planchon transferred the species to the genus Grevillea.There are 3 recognised subspecies:\n\nGrevillea manglesii subsp. dissectifolia (McGill.) McGill.\nGrevillea manglesii (Graham) Planch. subsp. manglesii\nGrivillea manglesii subsp. ornithopoda (Meisn.) McGill.",
    "Cultivation": "This species is hardy in cultivation, including humid areas and has proved useful as a screening shrub. It will grow in both full sun and part shade and prefers a well-drained situation.\n\n\n== References =="
