    "__SUMMARY__": "Grevillea eriostachya, also known as the yellow flame grevillea and the desert grevillea, is a shrub found in Western Australia, the south-west areas of the Northern Territory, and the north-west areas of South Australia. Because of the sweet taste of the shrub's flowers, Australian Aborigines used it as a sweetener and to add variety to their meals. Nectar eating birds are attracted to the flowers.",
