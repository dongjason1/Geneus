    "__SUMMARY__": "Jasminum mesnyi, the primrose jasmine or Japanese jasmine, is a species of flowering plant in the family Oleaceae, native to Vietnam and southern China (Guizhou, Sichuan, Yunnan). It is also reportedly naturalized in Mexico, Honduras and parts of the southern United States (Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, Arizona).Jasminum mesnyi is a scrambling evergreen shrub growing to 3 m (10 ft) tall by 1–2 m (3–7 ft) wide, with fragrant yellow flowers in spring and summer. The form usually found in cultivation has semi-double flowers. It is not frost-hardy. With suitable support it can be grown as a slender climber, though in confined spaces it will require regular pruning.Jasminum mesnyi has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.",
