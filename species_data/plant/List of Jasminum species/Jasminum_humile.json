    "__SUMMARY__": "Jasminum humile, the Italian jasmine or yellow jasmine, is a species of flowering plant in the Oleaceae family, native to Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Nepal, Burma (Myanmar), the Himalayas and south west China (Gansu, Guizhou, Sichuan, Xizang (Tibet), Yunnan). The species is widely cultivated and reportedly naturalized in Greece, Sicily and the former Yugoslavia.Growing 2.5–4 m (8–13 ft) tall by 3 m (10 ft) wide, it is a roundish semi-evergreen shrub with thick stems. It has stout, dark green leaves, 5 cm long, with 5-7 imparipinnate leaflets. In protected areas it retains its leaves over winter, though in cold winters its foliage and buds may freeze. It blooms in spring and summer with clusters of usually six yellow, scented flowers.The Latin specific epithet humile means \"low-growing\".Numerous cultivars have been developed for garden use, of which 'Revolutum' (syn. J. reevesii Hort.) has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\n\n== References =="
