    "Etymology": "Pelargonium is from Ancient Greek πελαργός (pelargós = 'stork'). Another name for pelargonium is 'storksbill' after the shape of its fruit; 'cordifolium' refers to the heart-shaped leaves (cor/cordis being 'heart' in Latin).",

It is a hairy plant with a slight apple scent and pale pink flowers with dark veins appearing from March to July. Its flat or curled, heart-shaped leaves are finely to coarsely toothed, entire or shallowly lobed, dark green on the upper surface and white-matted below. It is valued as a houseplant or as an outdoor perennial, climate permitting. Its leaves may be used in potpourris.",
