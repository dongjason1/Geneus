It is native to the mountains and deserts of southeastern California (Kern, Inyo and San Bernardino Cos), and southern Nevada (Clark and Esmeralda Cos).Galium matthewsii is a shrubby perennial growing from a woody base and reaching heights of about 20 to 30 centimeters. It forms short, thin, tangled masses. The small, sharp-pointed leaves grow in whorls of four about the stem at intervals.
