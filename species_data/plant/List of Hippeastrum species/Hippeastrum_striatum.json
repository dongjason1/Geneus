    "__SUMMARY__": "Hippeastrum striatum (striped Barbados lily) a flowering perennial herbaceous bulbous plant, in the family Amaryllidaceae, native to the southern and eastern regions of Brazil.",
    "Description": "The flowers, generally 2–4, are smaller than other members of the genus. The paraperigon features bristles at the throat of the tepal tube. The perigone is about 7.6–10 cm in size and the tepal segments are 2–2.5 cm broad in their middle. Their colour is a bright red with a green keel that extends half way up the segment. The stigma is trifid.",
    "Taxonomy": "Described in 1963 in Baileya. the name is derived from the Latin word striatus (striped). It is similar to H. petiolatum and H. puniceum.Earlier synonyms have included species of Callicore and Lais, now considered to be Hippeastrum, as well as species of Amaryllis, from which Hippeastrum was separated.",
    "Distribution": "Brazil, \nTanzania",
    "Ecology": "Produces numerous bulbils that facilitate its escape and naturalisation in tropical areas. It will grow from seeds in about two years.",
