    "__SUMMARY__": "Astragalus scaphoides, the bitterroot milkvetch, is a flowering plant in the family Fabaceae, found only in a small area of southwest Montana and adjacent parts of Idaho. It grows on shallow, south-facing slopes, in semi-arid sage scrub.\nAstragalus scaphoides is a perennial herbaceous plant, with pinnate leaves. The pale yellow flowers open in May and are visited by several species of bumblebees and solitary bees, including species from the genera Osmia and Anthophora.\nPlants can be found near Lemhi Pass on the Montana-Idaho border, and near Bannack State Park in Montana.\nPlants tend to flower in alternate years, similar to mast years in grasses and trees.",
