    "__SUMMARY__": "Astragalus tricarinatus is a rare species of milkvetch known by the common name triplerib milkvetch, or triple-ribbed milkvetch.\nIt is endemic to California, where it can be found in the region where the San Bernardino Mountains meet the Mojave Desert and the Colorado Desert. It grows in desert scrub and expanses of rock litter amongst stands of Joshua trees. The plant is known from only one location and there were twenty individuals remaining there in 1998, when it was federally listed as an endangered species.",
