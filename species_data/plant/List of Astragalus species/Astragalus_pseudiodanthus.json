It is native to the Great Basin deserts of Nevada and eastern California, such as the Tonopah area, where it grows in sandy habitat.\nThis plant is named for the very similar Astragalus iodanthus, of which it is sometimes treated as a variety.",
    "Description": "This is a small mat-forming perennial herb extending several stems from a stem base which lies beneath the surface of the sand. The leaves are up to 5 centimeters long and are made up of small crowded leaflets. The inflorescence is a cluster of reddish purple flowers.\nThe fruit is a legume pod up to about 2.5 centimeters long. It is fleshy when new and dries to a leathery texture.",
