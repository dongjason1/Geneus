    "__SUMMARY__": "Lilium columbianum is a lily native to western North America. It is also known as the Columbia lily or tiger lily (sharing the latter common name with several other lily species in its genus).",
    "Distribution": "Lilium columbianum occurs in lowland and montane forest openings and meadows from southern British Columbia in Canada south to northern California and east to Montana in the northwestern United States. Mostly occurring below 2,000 m (6,600 ft), it usually blooms in June through early August. There are a few isolated populations at high elevations in the Sierra Nevada as far south as Fresno County.",
    "Description": "Lilium columbianum grows up to 1.2 metres (3.9 ft) tall, and bears from few to numerous orange flowers with darker spots. The tepals are 3 to 6 cm long and the flowers are lightly scented. Like many true lilies, the leaves are arranged in whorls around the stem of the plant.",
    "Uses": "",
    "Uses-Food": "Coast Salish, Nuu-chah-nulth and most western Washington peoples steamed, boiled or pit-cooked its bulbs. Bitter or peppery-tasting, they were mostly used as a flavoring, often in soup with meat or fish.",
