    "__SUMMARY__": "Lilium lancifolium (syn. L. tigrinum) is an Asian species of lily, native to China, Japan, Korea, and the Russian Far East. It is widely planted as an ornamental because of its showy orange-and-black flowers, and has become naturalized in numerous scattered locations in eastern North America (particularly in New England).It is one of several species of lily to which the common name tiger lily is applied, and some regard this the correct species to which the name should be applied. Botanists for many years considered L. tigrinum the correct scientific name until it was determined that older name L. lancifolium refers to the same species. Under the rules of international botanical nomenclature, the older name takes precedence.",
    "Growth": "Like other true lilies, the flowers are borne on upright stems that are 80–200 centimetres (31–79 in) tall and bear lanceolate leaves 6–10 centimetres (2.4–3.9 in) long and 1–2 centimetres (0.39–0.79 in) broad. Lilium lancifolium produces aerial bulblets, known as bulbils, in the leaf axils. These bulbils are uncommon in Lilium species and they produce new plants that are clones of the original plant. Each flower lasts a few days and if pollinated produce capsules with many thin seeds.",
    "Cultivation and uses": "It is cultivated in Asia for its edible bulbs. The cultivar 'Splendens' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.",
