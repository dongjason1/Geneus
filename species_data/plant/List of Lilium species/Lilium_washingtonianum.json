    "__SUMMARY__": "Lilium washingtonianum is a North American plant species in the lily family. It is also known as the Washington lily, Shasta lily, or Mt. Hood lily. It is named after Martha Washington and not the state of Washington; in fact, as the northern range of the plant is near Mount Hood in Oregon, it does not naturally occur in the state of Washington.\nLilium washingtonianum is native to the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada of western North America. Its range is limited to the states of California and Oregon. It was also found within Table Rock Wilderness.",
    "Description": "Lilium washingtonianum grows up to 2 m tall, and bears large fragrant white or pinkish flowers that are often decorated with purplish spots. The tepals are 6 to 9 cm long and not strongly reflexed. It is typically found in chaparral, open woods, recently burned areas, or revegetating clearcuts.\nSubspeciesLilium washingtonianum subsp. purpurascens (Stearn) M.W.Skinner - flowers aging deep pink or lavender\nLilium washingtonianum subsp. washingtonianum - flowers aging pink or white",
