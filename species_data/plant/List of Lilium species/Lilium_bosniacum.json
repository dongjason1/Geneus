    "__SUMMARY__": "Lilium bosniacum is a lily native to Bosnia and Herzegovina. It's also known as Zlatni Ljiljan (Bosnian for golden lily) and Bosanski Ljiljan (Bosnian lily).\nL. bosniacum has often been lumped and split and lumped again. Some results of molecular studies support it as an infraspecific taxon of Lilium carniolicum. Lilium bosniacum, together with Lilium albanicum and Lilium jankae have been treated as varieties of Lilium carniolicum.\nHowever, extensive DNA-analyses have shown that this group is polyphyletic.",
