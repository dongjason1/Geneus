    "__SUMMARY__": "Lilium catesbaei, sometimes known as Catesby's lily, pine lily, leopard lily, tiger lily, or southern-red lily is a native of Florida and the coastal regions of the American Southeast, where it usually grows in damp areas from Louisiana to Virginia.Lilium catesbaei requires hot, wet, acidic soil inhospitable to most other lily species. Producing a single flower, it generally blooms late in the year. The flower is upright with 6 tepals (petals and sepals that look very similar). The tepals are curved backward and are orange toward the tip, yellow and purple-spotted toward the base.",
