Common names fireberry hawthorn and goldenberry hawthorn, as well as the scientific name all refer to the colour of the unripe fruit, although the mature fruit is red and in var. vernonensis is \"deep claret-colored … nearly black when over-ripe\".Three varieties C. chrysocarpa var. chrysocarpa, var. piperi, and var. vernonensis are recognized.",
