    "__SUMMARY__": "Campanula lactiflora, the milky bellflower, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Campanula of the family Campanulaceae, native to Turkey and the Caucasus. It is a medium-sized herbaceous perennial growing to 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in), with narrow, toothed leaves 5–12 cm (2–5 in) long. Large conical clusters of open, star-shaped flowers are produced on branching stems in summer. In favourable conditions it will self-seed with variable results. The flowers are usually white or pale blue, but numerous cultivars have been developed for garden use, in a range of colours.The Latin specific epithet lactiflora means \"milk-white flowers\".The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:-\n\n'Alba' (white)\n'Loddon Anna' (pale pink)\n'Prichard's Variety' (violet blue)\n\n\n== References =="
