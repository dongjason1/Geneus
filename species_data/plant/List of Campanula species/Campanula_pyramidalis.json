    "__SUMMARY__": "Campanula pyramidalis, the chimney bellflower, is a species of Campanula, native to southeastern Europe in Italy and the western Balkans. Campanula means \"bell-like\" referring to the bell-shape of its flowers, while pyramidalis means pyramidal or conical, which refers to its conical shape.It is a short-lived perennial herbaceous plant growing up to 1.5 m tall. The leaves are broad ovate on the lower part of the stem, slender lanceolate on the upper part of the stem. The flowers are bell-shaped, blue, 3–4 cm diameter. The flowers are hermaphroditic, and the plant is self-fertile. It grows in many different soil types, and can handle a wide pH range. It prefers a sunny or partially shaded area.\nIt is grown as an ornamental plant for its scented flowers; several cultivars have been selected with flower colour ranging from white to dark blue.",
