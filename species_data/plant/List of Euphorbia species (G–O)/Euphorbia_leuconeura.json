    "__SUMMARY__": "Euphorbia leuconeura, the Madagascar jewel, is a species of plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is endemic to Madagascar.  Its natural habitat is forest undergrowth in rocky areas. It can grow to a height of 1.8 m (6 ft), as a branching small tree, and propagates by shooting its seeds several feet into the air. It is threatened by habitat loss.",
    "Taxonomy": "The specific epithet leuconeura is derived from the two ancient greek words λευκός (leukós), meaning \"bright, white\", and νευρά (neurá), meaning \"nerve\".",
    "Cultivation": "The Madagascar Jewel is grown as a houseplant for its attractive foliage: dark green leaves, with white veins when young. Unlike many succulents, E. leuconeura is less susceptible to overwatering. It grows best in partial shade but tolerates full shade and is relatively easy to care for providing it is not exposed to cold drafts.",
    "Toxicity": "When damaged the plant secretes a white fluid which is toxic, causes severe skin irritation and may be a tumor promoting agent.\n\n\n== References =="
