The leaves are arranged in decussate pairs, elliptic in shape, 1.5–2.5 mm (0.06–0.1 in) long and more or less pressed against the stem.The flowers are scented and arranged in spike-like groups near the ends of the branches, each flower on a spreading stalk about 1 mm (0.04 in) long. The floral cup is top-shaped, about 2.5 mm (0.1 in) long, has 5 ribs and green appendages and is glabrous and slightly rough. The sepals are 5–6 mm (0.20–0.24 in) long, pink and spreading with 7 to 8 hairy lobes. The petals are bright pink, 5–6.5 mm (0.2–0.3 in) long and erect with a fringe a further 2–2.5 mm (0.08–0.1 in) long. The style is 4–5 mm (0.16–0.20 in) long, hairy and curved near the tip.

    "Conservation": "Verticordia wonganensis is classified as \"Priority Two\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is poorly known and known from only one or a few locations.",
    "Use in horticulture": "Verticordia wonganensis is usually propagated from cuttings but these are difficult to strike and those that do are difficult to establish in gardens.\n\n\n== References =="
