    "__SUMMARY__": "Protea scolymocephala, the thistle protea, is a flowering plant from the genus Protea native to South Africa. It's a small erect shrub between 0.5 and 1.5 meters tall. The leaves are linear-spatulate curving upwards. The flowerhead is yellow-green and small, with 3.5 - 4.5 cm across. The species flowers between June and November. The fruits are retained.\nProtea scolymocephala occupies sandy flats and coastal lowlands in the Western Cape from approximately the Olifants River in the north, through Cape Town to Hermanus in the east.
