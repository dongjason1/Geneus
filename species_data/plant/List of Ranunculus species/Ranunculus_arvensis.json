    "__SUMMARY__": "Ranunculus arvensis, the corn buttercup, devil-on-all-sides or scratch bur, is a plant species of the genus Ranunculus. It is native to Europe, but it can be found on other continents as an introduced species and sometimes a weed, including in North America and Australia. It was formerly a common annual arable weed in Britain, but is now rare there. It is most often found in moist places, such as spring puddles in meadows.",
