    "__SUMMARY__": "Ranunculus lapponicus, the Lapland buttercup, is distributed all over the arctic, with the exception of northern and eastern Greenland.\nIt is a low, prostrate plant with a creeping, underground stem (rhizome) which sends out long stalks and shoots bearing the flowers. The leaves are deeply tripartite, forming 3 lobes which are toothed or crenated. The flowers are yellow, solitary, generally having 6 (8) petals that are distinctly longer than the sepals. After flowering, the fruit forms a globular head of carpels held above the creeping plant.\nIt grows in wet localities, especially in moss carpets along beaches, streams and lakes.",
