    "__SUMMARY__": "Ribes viscosissimum is a North American species of currant known by the common name sticky currant. It is native to the Pacific Northwest, Columbia Plateau, Great Plains, Great Basin and Southwestern regions of western North America.Ribes viscosissimum grows in mountain forests, streambanks, and plateau sagebrush. It is a spreading to erect shrub growing one to two meters (40-80 inches) in height, its stem coated in sticky glandular hairs but lacking spines and bristles. It is resinous and fragrant. The highly glandular leaves have thick, rough blades divided into 3 rounded, toothed lobes, the lobes about the same size rather than having the middle lobe larger than the others as in some related species. The blades may be 8 centimeters (3.2 inches) long, borne on petioles up to 10 centimeters (4 inches) in length. The inflorescence is an erect or drooping raceme of several flowers clustered together. Each flower has a bell-shaped coat of five whitish, greenish, or pink-tinged sepals which spread at the tips into a corolla-like array, sometimes becoming reflexed. Inside are whitish petals surrounding the stamens and stigmas. The fruit is a blue-black berry a centimeter (0.4 inch) long or longer.\nIt has no known hazards, unlike its close relative, wax currant (Ribes cereum), large quantities of which can cause vomiting.",
