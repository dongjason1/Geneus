    "__SUMMARY__": "Ribes leptanthum is a spiny-stemmed, small-leaved species of gooseberry in the genus Ribes commonly called trumpet gooseberry.  It is native to Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, and Utah, where it is usually found in high-altitude canyons.",
    "Ethnobotany": "Historically the berries of R. leptanthum have been consumed in Native American cultures in a variety of ways: they are readily eaten fresh by Apache peoples, including the Chiricahua, Mescalero, and other peoples (specifically those in the vicinity of Isleta and Jemez in New Mexico); used as an ingredient in cakes made for overwintering by Chiricahua, and Mescalero peoples; and, in those communities where early-settling Spanish and Native American cultures have generally mingled or influenced each other, R. leptanthum  berries are used in recipes for jellies and wines.\n\n\n== References =="
