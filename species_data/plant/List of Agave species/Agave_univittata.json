    "__SUMMARY__": "Agave univittata, the thorn-crested century plant, is a plant species native coastal areas southern Texas and northeastern Mexico, at elevations less than 100 m (300 feet). It is often mistakenly called  Agave lophantha, but the name  A. univittata is older and therefore more in accord with nomenclatural rules of botany.Agave univittata has thick, fleshy leaves that are stiff and undulate (wavy) along the margins. It has sharp and prominent spines on the edges and tips of the leaves. Flowering stalk is up to 5 m (16 feet) tall, bearing greenish-white to yellow-ish green flowers.\n\n\n== References =="
