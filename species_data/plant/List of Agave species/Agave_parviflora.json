    "__SUMMARY__": "Agave parviflora is a species of succulent perennial flowering plant in the asparagus family, known by the common names Santa Cruz striped agave, smallflower century plant, and small-flower agave. It is native to Arizona in the United States and Sonora in Mexico.The specific epithet parviflora means \"small-flowered\".This agave produces a small rosette up to 25 cm (10 in) tall by 20 cm (8 in) wide. The succulent leaves are up to 20 cm (8 in) long and are a waxy dark green with white markings. The leaf margins have peeling fibers. The plant produces an inflorescence 1–2 m (3–7 ft)tall with cream or pale yellow flowers in summer. The flowers are pollinated by bees such as bumblebees.This species is the smallest agave in Arizona and is sought by collectors. For this reason the species has declined in its native habitat. There are only about two dozen natural populations in Arizona. Other threats to the species include road construction and mining.The plant is valued in cultivation and has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.Subspecies of the plant include ssp. parviflora and ssp. densiflora.",
