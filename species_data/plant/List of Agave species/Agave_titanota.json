    "__SUMMARY__": "Agave titanota, the chalk agave, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae. It is a medium-sized evergreen succulent perennial native to Oaxaca, Mexico.The plant forms a solitary rosette of broad whitish green leaves with variable spines, occasionally producing offsets. Mature plants may produce a flower head from 3m to 6m tall with yellow flowers. As it is monocarpic, this signals the death of the plant.\nIt can tolerate temperatures of −3 °C (27 °F), but in practice is best grown in a sheltered spot without severe frosts. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit.\n\n\n== References =="
