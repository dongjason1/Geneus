    "__SUMMARY__": "Angraecum leonis is a species of orchid propagated around 1922 by Ms. Edith Watson (18 November 1895 – 1 May 1967) of Home Farm, Woburn, England.\nIt was named in honor of Sir Herbert Leon, her father James Telford Watson's employer at Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire, where he was Estate Manager at the time.\nSir Herbert gave Edith Watson a book entitled \"Orchids, their culture and management\" by Watson and Chapman, on June 26, 1918, when she was 23 years of age. She won a Cultural Bronze Medal and F.C. Botanical Certificate at the Manchester and A.M.London show of 1922. She also propagated another orchid which she named Odonto. Crispum var. Colin, in honour of her eldest son Colin Barrow (b 1919).\nHer daughter was Jean Barrow, later to work at Bletchley Park during World War II.\nEdith Watson is buried at Olney Cemetery.",
