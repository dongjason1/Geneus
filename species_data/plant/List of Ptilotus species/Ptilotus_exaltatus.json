    "__SUMMARY__": "Ptilotus exaltatus Nees, also commonly known as the pink mulla mulla or tall mulla mulla, is one of the largest mulla mullas. The species is endemic to much of mainland Australia.\nThis robust perennial or ephemeral herb typically grows to a height of 1 metre (3.3 ft) tall but in a good season can grow to 1.5 m (4.9 ft) tall and  in poor years it may be only reach a few centimetres in height. There is a basal rosette of spathulate-oblanceolate smooth leaves up to 10 cm long, the stem leaves being shorter. The flower spikes are up to 10 cm long and 4 cm across with loosely hairy flowers. The species is widespread from the North-West coast of Australia east into the Northern Territory, New South Wales, Queensland and south-east to the eastern agricultural districts, Norseman and into South Australia.Ptilotus exaltatus was synonymised with Ptilotus nobilis in 2008, but a study in 2018 has reinstated P. exaltatus as a separate species based on strong morphological and ecological partitioning.\n\n\n== References =="
