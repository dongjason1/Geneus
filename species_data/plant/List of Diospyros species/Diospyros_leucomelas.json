    "__SUMMARY__": "Diospyros leucomelas (marble ebony, bois d'ebene marbre or bois d'ebene a veines) is a species of tree endemic to Mauritius.\nThis low, multi-stemmed tree species resembles the related species Diospyros egrettarum (and less so Diospyros revaughanii) in its dark, rectangular, leathery leaves, rounded leaf-base, very short petiole, and short fruits.\nDiospyros leucomelas can be distinguished by the red midribs of its leaves though, which remain into adulthood and become especially prominent on the leaf undersides.\nLike the coastal Diospyros egrettarum it was most common along the eastern coast of Mauritius. However D.leucomelas usually grew at mid altitudes, slightly further from the coast.\n\n\n== References =="
