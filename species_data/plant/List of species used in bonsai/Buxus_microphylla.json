    "__SUMMARY__": "Buxus microphylla, the Japanese box or littleleaf box, is a species of flowering plant in the box family \nfound in Japan and Taiwan. It is a dwarf evergreen shrub or small tree growing to 1 m (3.3 ft) tall and wide .The bright green leaves are 10–25 millimetres (0.39–0.98 in) long, oval with a rounded or notched tip. The species was first described from Japanese cultivated plants of an unknown origin. They are unknown in the wild.\nPlants from Taiwan are distinguished as Buxus microphylla var. tarokoensis S.Y.Lu & Y.P.Yang. Plants from China and Korea formerly often cited as Buxus microphylla var. sinica are now treated as a distinct species Buxus sinica.The species is grown as an ornamental plant, both in its native area and elsewhere in temperate regions around the world. It is particularly suitable for topiary or low hedging. Buxus microphylla var. compacta (Kingsville dwarf boxwood) and similar cultivars are frequently used for bonsai.\nThe cultivar ‘Faulkner’ (1 metre (3.3 ft) tall by 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) broad) has gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit.\n\n\n== References =="
