It is an erect annual plant that grows from 12 to 20 cm tall. Obovate or orbicular leaves, about 4-15 per plant, form basal rosettes. The leaves are generally 6-9.5 mm long and 4-6.5 mm wide. This species generally has one to three scapes and cymose inflorescences that are 12–20 cm long. Flowers are pink or mauve.\nIts habitat has been reported as being seepage areas, streambanks, sandstone pavement, or sandy depressions. It flowers in the southern hemisphere from April to August. S. lobuliflorum is most closely related to S. schizanthum. Its conservation status has been assessed as secure.",
