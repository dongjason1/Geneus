    "__SUMMARY__": "Grewia latifolia is a small shrub endemic to Northern and Eastern Australia. Growing to a height of 2m, the species is characterised by ovate leaves with serrated margins. The leaves are discolourous with green papery upper surfaces and pale green to yellow pubescent lower surfaces. The species is deciduous, shedding leaves in response to dry conditions. Cream coloured flowers are produced year round. Fruits are woody capsules with four externally visible compartments covered with coarse hairs. These fruits have a distinct similarity to dog testicles, giving rise to the common name of dogs balls. Other common names include emu berry and dysentery plant.",
