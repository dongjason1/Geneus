    "__SUMMARY__": "Grewia insularis  is a species of flowering plant in the Malvaceae, or mallow family, that is endemic to Christmas Island, an Australian territory in the north-eastern Indian Ocean.  Its specific epithet is the Latin for insular, referring to its island location.",
    "Description": "Grewia insularis is a shrub or small tree.  Its leaves are oblong to ovate, 40–110 mm long.  The yellow flowers are usually 1–3 in an umbel, often with several umbels from one leaf-axil.  The fruit is purple, often reduced to a subglobose drupe about 3 mm long.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Found only on Christmas Island, it occurs on the terraces on the northern coast.",
    "Relationships": "The fruit and flowers of G. insularis are similar to those of G. glabra, while the shape of its leaves closely resemble those of G. eriocarpa.",
