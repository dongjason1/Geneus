    "__SUMMARY__": "Wallisia cyanea (common name pink quill) is a species of flowering plant in the bromeliad family, native to the rainforests of Ecuador.  An epiphytic perennial growing to 50 cm (20 in) high by 50 cm (20 in) wide, it has stemless rosettes of thin, recurved leaves and paddle-shaped spikes of 20 pink bracts with violet flowers, in spring and autumn.The Latin specific epithet cyanea means \"blue\", referring to the intense purple-violet hue of the flowers.With a minimum temperature of 7 °C (45 °F), this plant is often cultivated as a low-maintenance houseplant in temperate regions, often sold alongside orchids or by itself. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\n\n== References =="
