    "__SUMMARY__": "Pultenaea juniperina, or prickly bush-pea, is a plant of the family Fabaceae native to Eastern Australia. It is a shrub to 3 metres sporting showy yellow-orange flowers with red markings. The leaves are 10 – 25 mm long and 1 – 4 mm wide with a pungent leaf apex (stiff pointy tip), hence the use of \"Prickly\" in the common name. It is widespread and common in heaths, sclerophyll forests and woodlands in Eastern Australia and Tasmania.",
