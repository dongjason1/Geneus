    "__SUMMARY__": "Pultenaea flexilis known as the Graceful Bush-pea is an erect shrub found in eastern Australia. Growing to 4 metres in height, it is found north of Deua National Park, New South Wales to the state of Queensland. The habitat is the drier eucalyptus woodlands on acidic, well drained soils. Often seen in gullies.\nLeaves are small and narrow, alternate on the stem with a noticeable tip. In spring, the plant may be a spectacular sight with abundant yellow and red flowers. The specific epithet flexilis is from Latin and it refers to the flexible leaves. The original specimen was collected in Sydney, and first published in 1805 by the eminent English botanist, James Edward Smith.",
