    "__SUMMARY__": "Epidendrum frutex is a high-altitude species of reed-stemmed Epidendrum orchid native to Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela.",
    "Description": "E. frutex Rchb.f. (1855) is closely related to E. frigidum Lind. (1855), growing terrestrially in \"open sphagnum uplands\".  The tall sympodial plants grow from 3/4 to 5 m tall.  As is typical of the subgenus E. subg. Epidendrum, the stems are covered from the base with distichous, tubular, leaf-bearing sheaths.  The narrow leathery leaves of E. frutex can grow more than 2 dm long.  The terminal inflorescence is a distichous (not secund) compound panicle bearing numerous small, fleshy yellow to green to brown flowers.  The triangular sepals are no longer than 6 mm.  The linear petals are slightly shorter than the sepals.  The lip is adnate to the column to its apex, heart-shaped where it diverges from the column, broader than it is long, and not divided into lobes.  A linear keel runs down the center of the lip.\nThis large Epidendrum is notable for producing seed capsules that are more than ten times the size of the flowers.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References =="
