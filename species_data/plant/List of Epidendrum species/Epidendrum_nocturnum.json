    "__SUMMARY__": "Epidendrum nocturnum (the \"nocturnal epidendrum\") is the type species of the genus Epidendrum of the Orchidaceae (Orchid family).\nThe species occurs in Florida, Bahamas, West Indies, Central America to northern Brazil and the Guyanas. Epidendrum nocturnum is common in South Florida.\nIt is usually autogamous (flowers self-pollinate) and sometimes cleistogamous (flowers self-pollinate before they open).\nThe haploid chromosome number of E. nocturnum has been determined as n = 20.  The diploid chromosome number has been determined both as 2n = 40 and as 2n = 80.In 1984, the variety E. nocturnum var. guadeloupense was determined to have a diploid chromosome number of 2n = 42—48.  On November 7, 2010, Kew did not recognize the existence of this variety in its World Checklist of Selected Plant Families.",
