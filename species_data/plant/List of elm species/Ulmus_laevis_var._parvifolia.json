    "__SUMMARY__": "Ulmus laevis var. parvifolia is a mutant variety of European White Elm found exclusively on the island of Ada Ciganlija, in the Sava at Belgrade, Serbia.",
    "Description": "The tree is small and has a dense crown. The leaves are much smaller than those of the species, 21 – 59 mm (average 40 mm) in length by 14 – 36 mm (average 26 mm) width, and chartreuse in colour. The specimen of var. parvifolia on Ada Ciganlija is very slow-growing, attaining a height of only 5.5 m in almost 60 years, with a d.b.h. of just 13 cm.",
    "Pests and diseases": "Not known, but the species has a field resistance to Dutch elm disease, through the presence of a triterpene, Alnulin, in the bark which acts as an antifeedant to the vector Scolytus beetles.",
    "Cultivation": "The tree is not known to have ever flowered, thus propagation is by cuttings only. The variety is not known to be in commerce in Serbia or elsewhere.\n\n\n== References =="
