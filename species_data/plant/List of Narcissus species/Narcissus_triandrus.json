    "__SUMMARY__": "Narcissus triandrus is a species of bulbous plant native to France, Spain and Portugal. The common name is \"Angel's Tears\", and the plant has pendulant (nodding or drooping) cream to yellowish flowers.Flower size varies, increasing from southeast to northwest, correlating with plant size, probably reflecting a rainfall gradient from the hot Mediterranean climate of the southeast to the cooler, wetter Atlantic climate found in the northwest. Changes in flower size correlate with pollinator fauna. Anthophoraspp. being dominant in the southern population and the larger-bodied Bombus spp. in the north.\n\n\n== References =="
