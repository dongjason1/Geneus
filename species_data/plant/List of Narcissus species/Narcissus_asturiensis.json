    "__SUMMARY__": "Narcissus asturiensis  is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountains of North Portugal and Spain, where it  grows at altitudes  up to 2000 m (6000 ft). This dwarf Narcissus is 7–12 cm (2.5– 5 in) tall and has small yellow flowers growing singly.\nThis is a threatened species in the wild, but it is amenable to cultivation.\nIt can be grown as a cold hardy garden plant, needing vernalization (a period of cold weather) in order to flower. As a garden plant, it will bloom in late January or early February at low altitudes.\nThis plant contains a number of alkaloids including hemanthamine, hemanthidine,  tazettine and epimacronine.",
