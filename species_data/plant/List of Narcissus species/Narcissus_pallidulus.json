    "__SUMMARY__": "Narcissus pallidulus is a species of the genus Narcissus (Daffodils) in the family Amaryllidaceae. It is classified in Section Ganymedes. It is native to Spain.",
    "Taxonomy": "Opinions vary as the status of this taxon. Zonnefeld (2208) discusses its status, believing both on genetic information and morphology and distribution that it is a separate species from Narcissus triandrus. For instance the leaf width at 2mm is much smaller. While Webb (1980) and Barra Lazaro (2000) consider it a variety or subspecies of the type species of the section (N. triandrus). he is supported in this by both Dorda and Fernandez Casas (1989) and Perez-Barrales et al. (2006).However officially according to the World Checklist and The Plant List it is considered Narcissus cernuus.\n\n\n== References =="
