    "__SUMMARY__": "Corymbia papuana, formerly (and sometimes still) known as Eucalyptus papuana, is an evergreen tree native to New Guinea and northern Australia.",
    "Classification": "In the 1990s, ghost gums, along with the bloodwoods, were reclassified from the genus Eucalyptus to the Corymbia, though not all botanists agree. This reclassification was based on the work of two botanists, Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson, who worked at the National Herbarium of New South Wales in Sydney.\n\n\n== References =="
