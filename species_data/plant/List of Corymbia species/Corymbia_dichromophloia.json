    "__SUMMARY__": "Corymbia dichromophloia is a member of the genus Corymbia native to Western Australia.The tree typically grows to a height of 12 metres (39 ft) and has a receding stocking of scaly red-brown bark at the base of the trunk with smooth powdery white bark above.The adult leaves have a disjunct arrangement. The leaf blade has a broad lanceolate to ovate shape that is basally tapered. The blade is dull, grey-green and concolorous with a length of 9 to 17 centimetres (4 to 7 in) and a width of 2 to 3.5 cm (0.8 to 1.4 in).It blooms between February and May producing white flowers. It has terminal compound conflorescences with 7 to 11 flowered umbellasters. It forms pyriform buds that are 5 to 8 millimetres (0.20 to 0.31 in) in length and have a diameter of 4 to 6 mm (0.16 to 0.24 in) with white or cream coloured flowers. Later it will form urceolate shaped fruits that have a diameter of 10 to 15 mm (0.39 to 0.59 in) and are 13 to 20 mm (0.51 to 0.79 in) with a depressed disc and enclosed valves. The red-brown cymbiform to ovoid seeds are regular or laterally compressed.It is found throughout the Kimberley region of Western Australia and the top end of the Northern Territory on ridges where it grows on red or yellow sandy soils over granite or sandstone.",
