    "__SUMMARY__": "Corymbia dallachiana commonly known as ghost gum or Dallachy's gum, is an evergreen tree that is native to Eastern Australia. It grows up to 20 metres in height and has white to cream and pink-tinged bark, often with brown scales. Bark sheds seasonally in thin scales. White flowers appear in from late summer through midwinter and the fruit are woody brown goblet shaped, valved capsules.Ghost Gum occurs in a wide range of environments from humid coastal regions to arid up to 1000 km inland. The plant is indicative of infertile and shallow soils in coastal regions but occupies a wider range of environments in more arid parts of its range. In the western parts of central Queensland the species intergrades with Corymbia aparrerinja, a species with which it was once lumped as C. papuana.\n\n\n== References =="
