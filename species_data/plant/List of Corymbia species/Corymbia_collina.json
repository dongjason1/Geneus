    "__SUMMARY__": "Corymbia collina, commonly known as the silver-leaved bloodwood, or the frosted bloodwood, is a tree member of the genus Corymbia native to Western Australia.The tree typically grows to a height of 7 to 18 metres (23 to 59 ft). It has rough fibrous and flaky bark and produces cream-white flowers from April to June.\nThe name Eucalyptus collina first appeared in the Western Mail newspaper on 2 June, 1906 in an article written by William Vincent Fitzgerald. The first formal description of the species was published in 1923 by Joseph Maiden in his book, A Critical Revision of the genus Eucalyptus, from an unpublished description by Fitzgerald. In 1995, Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson changed the name to Corymbia collina.",
