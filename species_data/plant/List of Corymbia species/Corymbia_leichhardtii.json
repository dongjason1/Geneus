The adult leaves are dull, grey-green, thin, concolorous and lanceolate in shape. The tree blooms between January and March and produces a terminal compound conflorescence with regular seven flowered umbellasters that have terete pedicels and penduncles.Corymbia leichhardtii has a range stretching from Mareeba in North Queensland south to Salvator Rosa National Park in Central Queensland. It is found in tropical and subtropical sclerophyll woodlands and grows in sandy soils over sandstone.\nIt was first described by the botanist Frederick Manson Bailey in 1906 in the Journal of Queensland Agriculture as Eucalyptus leichhardtii.",
