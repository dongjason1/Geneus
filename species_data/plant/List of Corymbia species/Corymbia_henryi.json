    "__SUMMARY__": "Corymbia henryi or the large-leaved spotted gum (previously known as Eucalyptus henryi) is a spotted gum found in eastern Australia. It occurs in north eastern New South Wales from around Coffs Harbour to near Brisbane in Queensland. The habitat is dry eucalyptus forest on sandy soils in fire prone areas.It is an attractive tree, up to 30 metres tall. Very similar to the spotted gum, but with adult leaves 15 to 28 cm long, and 2.5 to 4.5 cm wide.  Its gumnuts are, in the typical urn shape of most corymbias, 12 to 20 mm long and 10 to 16 mm in diameter.\n\n\n== References =="
