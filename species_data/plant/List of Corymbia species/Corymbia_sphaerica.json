    "__SUMMARY__": "Corymbia sphaerica, commonly known as the big-fruited bloodwood, is a member of the genus Corymbia native to the Northern Territory.\nThe small tree typically grows to a height of 4 metres (13 ft) and has red-brown or grey-brown tessellated bark that is persistent throughout. It forms dull, grey-green, thin, concolorous, opposite adult leaves that have a broad lanceolate to ovate or suborbiculate shape with a blade that are 3 to 8 centimetres (1.2 to 3.1 in) long and 1.5 to 4.5 cm (0.6 to 1.8 in) wide. Petioles are 0 to 2 mm (0.00 to 0.08 in) long and are narrowly flattened or channelled. When it bloods it produces terminal or axillary simple conflorescences with regular three to seven flowered umbellasters that have cream or yellow flowers. Fruits are found nearly all year round, they are globose and pedicellate 20 to 30 mm (0.79 to 1.18 in) long and with a diameter that is also 20 to 30 mm (0.79 to 1.18 in). Fruits contain dull to semi-glossy, red-brown and are regular and laterally compressed and cymbiform or ovoid in shape.Following fire it is a facultative resprouter sending up an epicormic sprout from its lignotuber.Corymbia sphaerica is found in the scrubland in the central Northern Territory with a range that extends from the eastern edge of the Tanami Desert to the Barrow Creek area. It is found in the Burt River, Davenport Murchison Ranges, Sturt Plateau and Tanami IBRA bioregions and grows in red sandy soil on rises.",
