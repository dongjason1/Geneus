    "__SUMMARY__": "Corymbia polysciada, commonly known as the apple gum or the paper-fruited bloodwood, is a member of the genus Corymbia native to the Northern Territory. The Wagiman peoples know the tree as bolomin.The tree typically grows to a height of 15 metres (49 ft) and forms a lignotuber. It has a covering of rough dark grey, tessellated bark over the lower part of the trunk with smooth creamy white to pale grey bark that sheds in thin scales covering the remainder of the trunk and branches. The crown leaves are opposite to alternate, smooth and concolorous with a glossy or dull green colour. The leaves have petioles that are 0.7 to 3.3 centimetres (0.3 to 1.3 in) in length. The blade of the leaf is ovate to elliptic to broadly lanceolate in shape 6 to 21 cm (2.4 to 8.3 in) long and 1 to 7.5 centimetres (0.4 to 3.0 in) wide, it is undulate with the base tapering to petiole and has a pointed apex. The tree is deciduous shedding leaves in mid dry season between June and August.\nIt blooms in June and from August to November producing a simple axillary conflorescence with irregular 7-flowered to 11-flowered umbellasters on terete pedicels.",
