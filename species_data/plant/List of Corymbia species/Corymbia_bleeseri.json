    "__SUMMARY__": "Corymbia bleeseri, commonly known as the smooth stemmed bloodwood or the glossy-leaved bloodwood, is a bloodwood native to Western Australia.The tree typically grows to a height of 8 to 15 metres (26 to 49 ft). It blooms between May and July producing white-cream flowers.It is found in lateritic or sandstone areas in the Kimberley region of Western Australia where it grows in skeletal soils.The species was first formally described as Eucalyptus bleeseri by the botanist Blakely in 1927 in the Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales. It was subsequently reclassified into the Corymbia genera by Kenneth Hill and Lawrence Alexander Sidney Johnson in 1995 in the work Systematic studies in the eucalypts.
