    "__SUMMARY__": "Corymbia paractia, commonly known as the Cable Beach ghost gum, is a member of the genus Corymbia native to Western Australia.The tree, which often has several stems, typically grows to a height of 4 to 6 metres (13 to 20 ft) but can reach 12 metres (39 ft). The bark is smooth and white in colour which sheds in thin scales but persists on the lower trunk. The leaves have a broad lanceolate shape with margins that are sometimes twisted. It blooms between April and May or October and December producing clusters of white flowers along leafless stems that later form ovoid glabrous fruits.The species is confined to a small area on the Kimberley coast, near Broome, where it grows in skeletal soils in the area between the coastal beach sand dunes and the red pindan soils.",
