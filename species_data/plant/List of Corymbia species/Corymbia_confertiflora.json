    "__SUMMARY__": "Corymbia confertiflora, commonly known as the broad leaf carbeen or the rough leaf cabbage gum, is a member of the genus Corymbia native to Western Australia.The tree typically grows to a height of 3 to 18 metres (10 to 59 ft). and is usually deciduous in the late dry season between September and October. It forms a lignotuber and has rough bark that is tessellated close to the base and smooth white above which it sheds in thin flakes.\nAdult leaves are dull green and mostly opposite or sometimes sub-opposite, sessile or shortly petiolate, with petioles 0.1 to 0.5 centimetres (0.04 to 0.20 in) long. The leaf blade is cordate to broadly elliptic or lanceolate to ovate, 5 to 21 cm (2 to 8 in) long and 1.8 to 10 cm (1 to 4 in). New growth is often reddish purple in colour. It produces cream-white flowers from September to December.",
