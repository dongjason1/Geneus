    "__SUMMARY__": "Corymbia leptoloma, commonly known as the  Paluma Range yellowjacket or yellow jacket, is a member of the genus Corymbia native to Queensland.The tree typically grows to a height of 20 metres (66 ft) and is covered with rough, tessellated grey-yellow bark on the trunk and larger branches. Adult leaves are bright green on the upper surface and paler underneath, they have a lanceolate shape and are 25 to 40 millimetres (1.0 to 1.6 in) wide.Corymbia leichhardtii sometimes occurs in the same vicinity and can be distinguished from C. leptoloma by dull leaves that are a similar colour on both sides.\nThe population of C. leptoloma is unknown but it is restricted to a small area north west of Townsville. It grows in remnant areas of wet sclerophyll forest in association with Syncarpia glomulifera, Eucalyptus resinifera and Corymbia intermedia in gullies or on hillsides. It occurs in coarse\nsandy soils derived from granite.",
