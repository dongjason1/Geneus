    "__SUMMARY__": "Corymbia scabrida, commonly known as the rough-leaved yellowjacket, is a member of the genus Corymbia native to Queensland.\nThe tree typically grows to a height of 15 metres (49 ft) and has pale brown to yellow-brown or orange bark that is thick,soft, tessellated and persistent throughout. Adult leaves are disjunct and lanceolate to elliptic or ovate in shape. The leaves are dull, green, thick, discolorous and 6 to 12 cm (2.4 to 4.7 in) long and 16 to 35 mm (0.63 to 1.38 in) wide. It blooms in October producing compound terminal conflorescence with regular seven-flowered that are cream or white umbellasters. Fruits are produced later that are ovoid to urceolate in shape, they are pedicellate and contain regular and flattened seeds.C. scabrida has a restricted distribution in Central Queensland that grows on low sandstone ridges and hills in shallow, sandy, loamy or gravelly soils. It is found in woodland communities and is often co-dominant in association with Eucalyptus melanophloia, Corymbia clarksoniana, Angophora leiocarpa, Eucalyptus chloroclada and Corymbia polycarpa.",
