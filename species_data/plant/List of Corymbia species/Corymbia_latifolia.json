    "__SUMMARY__": "Corymbia latifolia, commonly known as the round leaf bloodwood or the round-leaved bloodwood, is a bloodwood native to northern Australia.\nIndigenous Australians of the Yangman peoples know the plant as wubam or dolyan, the Ngarinyman know it as jadburru, the Warray as warrajan and the Wagiman as jimarnin.The tree typically grows to a height of 5 to 15 metres (16 to 49 ft) with rough bark that is flaky on the trunk. It blooms between January and March producing white flowers. It forms a lignotuber and has alternate adult leaves with petioles that are 2 to 5 centimetres (0.8 to 2.0 in) long. The leaves have a blade that is deltoid to broadly ovate or elliptical 7 to 16.5 cm (2.8 to 6.5 in) long and 4 to 12.3 cm (1.6 to 4.8 in) wide.It is found on rocky slopes, plateaus and hills growing in sandy soils and has a range across the north of Australia extending from Queensland through the Northern Territory to the Kimberley region of Western Australia.",
