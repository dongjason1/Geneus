    "__SUMMARY__": "Corymbia rhodops, commonly known as the red-throated bloodwood, is a member of the genus Corymbia native to Queensland.The tree typically grows to a height of 15 metres (49 ft) and forms a lignotuber. The bark is red-brown to grey-brown, tessellated and persistent throughout.  Smaller branches are smooth-barked. Adult leaves are disjunct, glossy, green, thick, discolorous, with a lanceolate to broad lanceolate shape. They are basally tapered with a length of 8 to 15 centimetres (3.1 to 5.9 in) and a width of 1 to 2.5 cm (0.39 to 0.98 in). When the tree blooms in the flowers form in terminal clusters with flower buds in egg shaped umbels of seven, on long stalks, 8 to 15 mm (0.31 to 0.59 in) in length when mature. Fruits form later which are barrel-shaped with a length of 7 to 28 mm (0.28 to 1.10 in) and a width of 12 to 20 mm (0.47 to 0.79 in) and having four cavities.Corymbia rhodops was listed as vulnerable under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act in 2008. The plants limited range but the main identified threat to the tree is the destruction of habitat due to mining activity.",
