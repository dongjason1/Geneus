    "__SUMMARY__": "Corymbia dunlopiana, commonly known as Dunlop's bloodwood, Oenpelli bloodwood, or the indigenous name of Bongonyin, is a member of the genus Corymbia native to the Northern Territory.The tree typically grows to a height of 7 metres (23 ft) and often has twisted irregular branches. The grey-brown over reddish-brown bark is rough, thick and variably tessellated. The leaves are leaves opposite and sessile with a cordate to oblong-lanceolate blade. They are dull, yellow-green to light green to grey-green with a length of 3.5 to 12 centimetres (1 to 5 in) and 2 to 6 cm (0.8 to 2.4 in) wide. The tree has a scraggy and untidy habit. The branchlets, leaves and flower-buds are all rough and hairy. It produces inflorescences with red flowers from the end of the dry season to early in the wet season.C. dunlopiana has a range that extends from the Claravale to the Daly River as far east as Gimbat near Jim Jim in the open savannah woodland. It prefers rising ground, outcrops and ridges usually with skeletal soils.",
