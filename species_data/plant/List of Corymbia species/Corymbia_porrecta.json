    "__SUMMARY__": "Corymbia porrecta, commonly known as the grey bloodwood, is a member of the genus Corymbia native to the Northern Territory.The tree grows to a height of 18 metres (59 ft) and has grey to pale brown tessellated bark throughout. Adult leaves are disjunct and a dull, grey-green colour. They are thick, concolorous and have a lanceolate or broad lanceolate shape. Leaves are basally tapered and 12 to 20 centimetres (5 to 8 in) long and 3 to 6.5 cm (1.2 to 2.6 in) wide with petioles that are narrowly flattened.Following a fire the tree is a facultative resprouter depending on conditions such as moisture and the fire intensity.The species is found in the monsoonal lowland areas of the eastern top end of the Northern Territory. Its distribution is between Litchfield and Darwin east to Jabiru out to the Coburg Peninsula including Bathurst and Melville Island. It grows in shallow sandy or gravelly soils on flat or slightly rising ground in woodland areas.",
