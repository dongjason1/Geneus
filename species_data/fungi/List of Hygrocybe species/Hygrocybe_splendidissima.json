    "__SUMMARY__": "Hygrocybe splendidissima, commonly known as the splendid waxcap, is a mushroom of the waxcap genus Hygrocybe. Found in Europe, it was originally described as new to science in 1960 by British mycologist Peter Darbishire Orton as a species of Hygrophorus. The type was collected by Orton in fields near Membury, Devon, in 1957 Meinhard Moser transferred the species to the genus Hygrocybe in 1967. Derek Reid thought that the fungus was more appropriately classified as a form of the scarlet waxy cap, Hygrocybe punicea.",
