    "__SUMMARY__": "Psathyrella aquatica is a species of fungus from Oregon, first described in the journal Mycologia in 2010. It represents the first ever report of a basidiomycete fruiting underwater.\nIt was found by Southern Oregon University professor Robert Coffan in the Rogue River in the U.S. state of Oregon. Coffan found the mushroom in 2005, and his colleagues Darlene Southworth and Jonathan Frank in the biology department at Southern Oregon University confirmed that the mushroom was a unique discovery.The mushroom's stipe appears to be quite strong, and is anchored up to 0.5m deep in sediment, in order to stand up to the fast-moving river currents where it is primarily found.\n\n\n== References =="
