    "__SUMMARY__": "Penicillium glaucum is a mold that is used in the making of some types of blue cheese, including Bleu de Gex, Rochebaron, and some varieties of Bleu d'Auvergne and Gorgonzola.  (Other blue cheeses, including Bleu de Bresse, Bleu du Vercors-Sassenage, Brebiblu, Cambozola, Cashel Blue, Danish blue, Fourme d'Ambert, Fourme de Montbrison, Lanark Blue, Roquefort, Shropshire Blue, and Stilton use Penicillium roqueforti.)\nIn 1874, Sir William Roberts, a physician from Manchester, noted that cultures of the mold did not display bacterial contamination.  Louis Pasteur would build on this discovery, noting that Bacillus anthracis would not grow in the presence of the related mold Penicillium notatum.  Its antibiotic powers were independently discovered and tested on animals by French physician Ernest Duchesne, but his thesis in 1897 was ignored.Penicillium glaucum feeds on only one optical isomer of tartaric acid, which makes it extremely useful in chemistry projects on chirality.Penicillium glaucum is a rejected name, as it has been used for almost any Penicillium isolate that has blue-green conidia (and most Penicillia have green or blue-green conidia). Penicillium glaucum is often used instead of Penicillium roqueforti, the mould used for fermenting blue-mould cheeses. P. roqueforti is the correct name for the fungus used for producing blue-mould cheeses. \n\n\n== References =="
