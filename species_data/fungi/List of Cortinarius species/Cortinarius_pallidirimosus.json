    "__SUMMARY__": "Cortinarius pallidirimosus is a species of fungus in the large mushroom genus Cortinarius (subgenus Phlegmacium). It was described as new to science in 2014 from specimens collected in Finland. The fungus is found throughout Fennoscandia, in Russia, and in Oregon (United States). It fruits on the ground singly or in small groups in boreal forest, mesic forest, and mixed forests with birch. Fruitbodies are distinguished in the field by their cream-coloroured caps with hygrophanous streaks, the honey-like odor of the flesh, and the association with birch. The specific epithet pallidirimosus refers to the pale, streaked cap. C. caesiophylloides is a closely related sister species.",
