    "__SUMMARY__": "Cortinarius pseudocupreorufus is a species of fungus in the large mushroom genus Cortinarius (subgenus Phlegmacium). It was originally described as new to science in 1944 by American mycologist Alexander H. Smith as a variety of Cortinarius orichalceus. Molecular and morphological data suggests that it is sufficiently distinct to warrant recognition as a distinct species, and it was renamed in 2014. The specific epithet pseudocupreorufus refers to its resemblance to Cortinarius cupreorufus.",
