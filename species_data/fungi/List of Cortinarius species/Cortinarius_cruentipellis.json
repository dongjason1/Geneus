    "__SUMMARY__": "Cortinarius cruentipellis is a rare species of agaric fungus in the subgenus Phlegmacium of the large mushroom genus Cortinarius. Described as new to science in 2014, it is found in northern Europe—Estonia, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden—where it grows on the ground in temperate and hemiboreal forests dominated by hazel and oak trees, and also in wooded pastures and parks. The cap of the mushroom is hemispherical to convex, measuring 3–7.5 cm (1.2–3.0 in) in diameter. It is yellowish brown in the center, becoming more yellow towards the cap margin. The specific epithet cruentipellis refers the blood red droplets in the cap cuticle.",
