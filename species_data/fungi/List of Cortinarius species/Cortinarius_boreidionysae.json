    "__SUMMARY__": "Cortinarius boreidionysae is a species of fungus in the large mushroom genus Cortinarius (subgenus Phlegmacium). Found in Finland, it grows in northern boreal forests of predominantly Norway spruce (Picea abies). The fungus was described as new to science in 2014 by mycologists Ilkka Kytövuori, Kare Liimatainen, Tuula Niskanen, and Balint Dima. The specific epithet boreidionysae refers to its close relationship to C. dionysae, and its boreal distribution.",
