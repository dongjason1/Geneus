    "__SUMMARY__": "Cortinarius balteaticlavatus is a species of fungus in the large mushroom genus Cortinarius (subgenus Phlegmacium). Found in Finland, where it grows in mixed forests with trees such as birch, poplar, willow, spruce, and pine, it was described as new to science in 2014. Fruitbodies occur from mid-August to mid-September. The specific epithet balteaticlavatus refers to both its affinity to C. balteatus and its club-shaped (clavate) stipe.",
