    "__SUMMARY__": "Russula rosea (synonym Russula lepida), known as the rosy russula, is a north temperate, some consider it edible other inedible, [1]  commonly found mushroom of the large \"brittlegill\" genus Russula.\nThe cap is convex when young, later flat, mostly bright cinnabar to carmine red; often with yellow spots and up to 10 cm in diameter.\nThe gills are pale straw-yellow, brittle, and occasionally with a red edge at the rim of the cap. The spores are pale-cream.\nThe stem is usually flushed carmine, but can be pure white. The flesh is hard and bitter tasting.\nThis mushroom is commonly found in coniferous forests or near beech trees.",
    "Similar species": "The rare Russula pseudointegra is distinguished by its hot tasting flesh. Red-stemmed forms of R.rosea could also be confused with Russula xerampelina, but the latter has softer flesh and no woody flavour.",
