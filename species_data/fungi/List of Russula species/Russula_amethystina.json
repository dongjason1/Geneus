    "__SUMMARY__": "Russula amethystina is a conspicuous mushroom, which appears sporadically from mid-summer until the autumn under spruce and fir trees. In Northern Europe, it is very rare. It is edible, but not very easy to distinguish from similarly coloured Russula species, and practically identical to Russula turci from which it can only be distinguished by microscopic differences in spore texture.",
    "Description": "The cap can be up to 12 cm in diameter and varies in colour between violet, lilac, wine-red and wine-red-brown.\nThe cap skin can be pulled off from the edge, right to the centre.\nThe gills are from cream to bright yellow. Spore print is cream to light orange.\nThe hollow stipe is initially white, later becoming yellowish or brownish.",
