    "__SUMMARY__": "The blusher is the common name for several closely related species of the genus Amanita.  A. rubescens, found in Europe and eastern North America, and A. novinupta in western North America. Both their scientific and common names are derived from the propensity of their flesh to turn pink on bruising, or cutting.\nThe mushroom is edible and tasty, sought for in several European countries. Readily recognizable by its pinkish color on the bottom of the stem.\nIt is avoided by novice mushroomers as without knowledge it can be confused with deadly poisonous species.",
    "Description": "The European blusher has a reddish-brown convex pileus (cap), that is up to 15 cm across, and strewn with small cream-coloured warts. It is sometimes covered with an ochre-yellow flush which can be washed by the rain. The flesh of the mushroom is white, becoming pink when bruised or exposed to air. This is a key feature in differentiating it from the poisonous false blusher or panther cap (Amanita pantherina), whose flesh does not. The stipe (stem) is white with flushes of the cap colour, and grows to a height of up to 15 cm. The gills are white and free of the stem, and display red spots when damaged.\nThe ring is striate (i.e. has ridges) on its upper side, another feature distinguishing it from Amanita pantherina.\nThe spores are white, ovate, amyloid, and approximately 8 by 5 µm in size.\nThe flavour of the uncooked flesh is mild, but has a faint acrid aftertaste. The smell is not strong.\nThe mushroom is often attacked by insects.",
    "Description-Distribution and habitat": "It is common throughout much of Europe and eastern North America, growing on poor soils as well as in deciduous and coniferous woodlands, appearing from June through to November in the UK. It has also been recorded from South Africa, where it is thought to have been accidentally introduced with trees imported from Europe.In eastern North America, Amanita rubescens is frequently parasitized by Hypomyces hyalinus.  Parasitized fruiting bodies are extremely difficult to recognize unless they occur in conjunction with healthy ones, although some retain the \"blushing\" characteristic of the species.",
    "Amanita novinupta": "A species found in the western U.S., only recently formally described and until then frequently misidentified as A. rubescens; see MykoWeb - Fungi of California - Amanita novinupta for details.",
    "Other species": "Closely related species include Amanita brunneolocularis,  A. orsonii, A. rubescens var. alba, and A. rubescens var. congolensis.",
    "Uses": "Both of these species are edible when cooked. European Amanita rubescens is known to contain a hemolytic protein in its raw state; it is unknown whether North American A. rubescens and A. novinupta are similarly toxic when eaten raw. This protein is destroyed by cooking, so it is important to cook this mushroom before eating.\nAmanita novinupta is highly regarded as a choice edible in the region in which it is found. However, the edibility of blusher species other than A. rubescens and A. novinupta has not been established and experimentation is not advised.",
