    "__SUMMARY__": "Infundibulicybe gibba (also known as Clitocybe gibba) is a species of gilled mushroom which is common in European woods.  In English it is sometimes known as the  common funnel.",
    "Naming": "This species was originally described by the mycologist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1801 as Agaricus gibbus, at a time when gilled mushrooms were generally all assigned to genus Agaricus.  Then in 1871 in his guide to mycology (\"Der Führer in die Pilzkunde\"),  Paul Kummer allocated the species to the genus Clitocybe, which previously (according to the system of Fries) had only been a tribe within genus Agaricus.In 2003 Harri Harmaja created the new genus Infundibulicybe for some of the larger members of the former Clitocybe and he included Infundibulicybe gibba as the type species.  A couple of authorities still keep it in genus Clitocybe, however.The older name Clitocybe infundibuliformis is often identified as a synonym of I. gibba, but according to Species Fungorum that use was incorrect and the original C. infundibuliformis was a different mushroom.The epithet gibba comes from the Latin adjective \"gibbus\", meaning \"humped\" or \"gibbous\".  The name infundibuliformis derives from the Latin \"infundibulum\", a funnel, with the suffix \"-formis\" - so it means \"funnel-shaped\".",
    "Description": "This section uses the given references throughout.\nThe matt slightly felted cap grows from about 3 cm to 8 cm, and is beige to ochraceous, also sometimes with a pink tinge.  It soon becomes funnel-shaped but often has a small bulge (an \"umbo\") in the centre.\nThere is no ring or other veil remnant.  The stem is white or whitish and up to about 6 cm long and 1 cm in diameter.\nThe white gills are crowded and very decurrent (running down the stem).\nIt has a faint \"cyanic\" smell, like new-mown hay, and the taste is mild.  However there is also a central European variety \"adstringens\" which has an unpleasant taste.\nThe tear-shaped spores are around 5.5-8 µm by 4-5 µm.",
    "Distribution, habitat, ecology and human impact": "This gregarious saprobic mushroom grows on soil in deciduous or (less commonly) coniferous woods and may be found from summer to autumn.  It sometimes forms fairy rings.\nIt is very common throughout Europe, and occurs in North America and Japan.It is edible when young, but said to be of mediocre quality.  It can be fried or used in risottos or soups etc.  The stems are tough and may be discarded.An extract of I. gibba exhibits inhibitory activity on thrombin.",
