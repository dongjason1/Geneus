    "__SUMMARY__": "Amanita strobiliformis is a species of mushroom. It is commonly referred to as Warted Amanita.",
    "Description": "The cap is 3 to 10 inches across, is rough with warts which sometimes fall away leaving the cap smooth, whitish, and sometimes has some brown. The gills are free and rounded behind. The  veil is large and sometimes adhere to the margin of the cap. The stipe (stem) is 3 to 8 inches long, thick, white, bulbous, and sometimes weighs a pound. The spores are elliptical.",
    "Edibility": "The genus Amanita contains some of the most toxic fungi known. Some amanitas are deadly in only very small doses, while others are relatively harmless and sometimes even considered fit for human consumption. There are different views on A. strobiliformis edibility. Some sources advice against consuming them, other sources considers them edible.",
    "Edibility-Toxicity": "Amanita strobiliformis contains ibotenic acid and muscimol like Amanita muscaria and Amanita pantherina. In combination with muscimol, ibotenic acid is a neurotoxin that can cause brain lesions. In many sources the mushroom is said to be harmless, but still then its edibility is doubted and uncertain, so caution should be taken before consuming this fungus. As with many other fungi, and plants in general, toxin levels may vary depending on the growing conditions, which in turn may explain the differences in evaluating edibility.",
    "Habitat": "The species can be found in light woods or on the borders of the woods, usually by itself or in clusters. The mushroom is rare.\n\n\n== References =="
