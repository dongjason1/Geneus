    "__SUMMARY__": "Rubroboletus lupinus, commonly known as the wolf bolete, is a bolete fungus of the genus Rubroboletus. Originally described by Elias Magnus Fries in 1838 as species of Boletus, it was transferred to Rubroboletus in 2015, a genus circumscribed to host other allied reddish-colored, blue-staining bolete species forming a distinct clade. The species epithet is derived from the Latin word lupus, meaning \"wolf\".\nMolecular studies have revealed considerable genetic variation among European populations of R. lupinus, placing it in a clade sister to Rubroboletus dupainii. The species is found in warm broad-leaved forests, forming ectomycorrhizal associations with various species of oak (Quercus) and sweet chestnut (Castanea).",
