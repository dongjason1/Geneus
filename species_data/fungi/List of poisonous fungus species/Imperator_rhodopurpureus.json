Initially described as Boletus rhodopurpureus, it was transferred to the new genus Imperator in 2015. The bolete is considered critically endangered in the Czech Republic.",
    "Description": "The cap is cushion-like, up to 15 cm in diameter; faint yellow- or pink-buff when young, later flushing red from the rim and becoming blotched with yellow, red and olivaceous tones.\nThe tubes are orange or red at first, then turning dark blue when cut. The spores are olive-brown. The stem is rather short, and sometimes very bulbous. The flesh is pale yellow, turning blue when cut.",
