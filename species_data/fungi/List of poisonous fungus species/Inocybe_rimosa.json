    "__SUMMARY__": "Inocybe rimosa (formerly known as Inocybe fastigiata) is a poisonous mushroom native to Europe. Its toxic ingredient is muscarine, discovered during the 1930s.German naturalist Jacob Christian Schäffer described this species in 1774.  Lucien Quélet transferred it to the genus Inocybe in 1872.I. fastigiata has a brownish fibrous cap, and stalk that lacks a ring.\nIn Israel, I. fastigiata grows under Palestine oak (Quercus calliprinos) and pines, with mushrooms still appearing in periods of little or no rain as they are mycorrhizal.In Israel, it is confused with edible mushrooms of the genus Tricholoma, particularly Tricholoma terreum, and Suillus granulatus, all of which grow in similar habitat.\n\n\n== References =="
