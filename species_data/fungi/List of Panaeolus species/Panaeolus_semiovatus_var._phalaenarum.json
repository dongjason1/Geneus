    "__SUMMARY__": "Panaeolus semiovatus var. phalaenarum is a common and widely distributed medium-sized grey mushroom that grows on dung.\nPanaeolus semiovatus var. phalaenarum is often mistaken for Panaeolus semiovatus.",
    "Taxonomy": "The binomial Panaeolus antillarum that previously referred to a closely related species, is now reduced to synonymy with Panaeolus semiovatus var. phalaenarum by most authorities. This feeds the suspicion that P.semiovatus var.phalaenarum, and P.antillarum are possibly the same species.",
    "Description": "Panaeolus semiovatus var. phalaenarum is a medium-sized mushroom which has a cap that is 2 to 4 cm, convex, and is white to yellowish. Often mistaken for its larger cousin Panaeolus semiovatus var. semiovatus, from which it differs in being more slender and having no annulus (ring).This mushroom prefers tropical climates.",
