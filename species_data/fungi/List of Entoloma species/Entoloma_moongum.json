    "__SUMMARY__": "Entoloma moongum is a South Australian species of fungus in the large agaric genus Entoloma (subgenus Leptonia). It was described as new to science by mycologist Cheryl Grgurinovic; the original holotype collections were made from Belair National Park in the 1930s by John Burton Cleland, who erroneously referred the fungus to Leptonia lampropus (now Entoloma lampropus).The fruitbody has a dark brown to purplish brown cap up to 19 mm (0.75 in) in diameter with a surface that is finely fibrillose, and a cap cuticle consisting of narrow hyphae. The spores measure 9.6–13.6 by 5.6–8.4 µm and have 5–6 blunt angles. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, measuring 34.4–48.8 by 9.6–12.8 µm, with sterigmata up to 6 µm long. The specific epithet derives from the Aboriginal word moonga, meaning \"dark\".",
