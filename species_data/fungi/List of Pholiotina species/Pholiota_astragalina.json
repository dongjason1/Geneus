    "__SUMMARY__": "Pholiota astragalina is a species of fungus in the family Strophariaceae. It was first described scientifically in 1821 by Elias Magnus Fries as a species of Agaricus. Rolf Singer transferred it to the genus Pholiota in 1951. Fruitbodies of the fungus have pinkish-orange caps measuring 2–5.5 cm (0.8–2.2 in) in diameter. They produce a reddish-brown spore print. Spores are oval to elliptical, smooth with thin walls, and measure 5–7 by 4–4.5 µm. In North America, the fungus is found in the United States and Canada. In Europe, it has been recorded from France, Sweden, and Switzerland.",
