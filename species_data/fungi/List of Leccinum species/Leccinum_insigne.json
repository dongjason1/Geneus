    "__SUMMARY__": "Leccinum insigne, commonly known as the aspen bolete or the aspen scaber stalk, is a species of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. Described as new to science in 1966, it is found in North America, where its range extends from eastern Canada south to New Jersey and west to the northern Rocky Mountains. It is edible. However, there have been documented cases of adverse reactions, ranging from headaches to gastrointestinal distress, which may or may not be attributed to food sensitivities alone. The specific epithet insigne means \"distinctive or outstanding\".",
