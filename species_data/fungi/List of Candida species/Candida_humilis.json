    "__SUMMARY__": "Candida humilis is a species of yeast in the genus Candida. It commonly occurs in sourdough and kefir cultures, along with different species of lactic acid bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus paralimentarius, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis).  Candida humilis is the most representative yeast species found in type I sourdough ecosystems. The effects of electric field strength, pulse width and frequency, or pulse shape is significant on the membranes of Candida humilis, but not very noticeable.C. Humilis was separated from C. Milleri in The Yeasts (fifth edition) in September 2016, although this is not universally accepted and they are still considered synonymous.\n\n\n== References =="
