    "__SUMMARY__": "Aspergillus stella-maris is a species of fungus in the genus Aspergillus. It is from the Nidulantes section. The species was first described in 2008. A. stella-maris has been reported to produce emericellin and shamixanthone. It has star-shaped ascospores.The genome of A. stella-maris was in 2016 sequenced as a part of the Aspergillus whole-genome sequencing project - a project dedicated to performing whole-genome sequencing of all members of the Aspergillus genus. The genome assembly size was 34.00 Mbp.",
    "Growth and morphology": "Aspergilus stella-maris has been cultivated on both Czapek yeast extract agar (CYA) plates and Malt Extract Agar Oxoid® (MEAOX) plates. The growth morphology of the colonies can be seen in the pictures below.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== References =="
