    "__SUMMARY__": "Leucoagaricus rubrotinctus is a widespread species of fungus in the family Agaricaceae. It was described as new to science in 1884 by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck as Agaricus rubrotinctus. Rolf Singer transferred it to the genus Leucoagaricus in 1948. The fungus may be a complex of several closely related species.\n\n\n== References =="
