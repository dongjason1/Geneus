    "__SUMMARY__": "Inocybe whitei, or Inocybe pudica, is a species of agaric fungus in the family Cortinariaceae.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was originally defined as Agaricus whitei by Berkeley and Broome in 1876 and transferred to the genus Inocybe by Saccardo in 1887.  The species was also described independently as Inocybe pudica by Robert KÃ¼hner in 1947.  Nowadays the two names are considered synonyms, with Berkeley and Broome's name taking precedence.The epithet whitei was given in honour of Dr. Buchanan White, a naturalist of Perthshire.",
