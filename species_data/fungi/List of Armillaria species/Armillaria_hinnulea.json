    "__SUMMARY__": "Armillaria hinnulea is a species of mushroom in the Physalacriaceae family. This rare species is found only in Australia and New Zealand; in Australia, it is a secondary pathogen (i.e., causing disease only after a primary pathogen has damaged the host) of wet sclerophyll forests, and causes a woody root rot. A 2008 phylogenetic study of Australian and New Zealand populations of A. hinnulea suggests that the species was introduced to New Zealand from Australia on two different occasions, once relatively recently  and another time much longer ago.",
