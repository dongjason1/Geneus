    "__SUMMARY__": "Gymnopilus purpuratus is mushroom which grows in clusters on dead wood, pig dung and wood chip mulch. It is widely distributed and has been recorded in Argentina, Australia, Chile, the UK and Germany.  It has a rusty orange spore print and contains the hallucinogen psilocybin.\nA chemical analysis done by Jochen Gartz found that this species contains 0.34% psilocybin, 0.29% psilocin and 0.05% baeocystin.  [1]",
    "Description": "The cap ranges from 1.5 to 6 cm across, is convex to obtuse, and is reddish brown with a dry scaly surface which is sometimes cracked in age.  The stem is brown-red and covered by fibers and has blue-green spots where the stem is damaged.  The gills are crowded, yellow to orange, and adnexed.  The stem is dusted with rusty orange spores and has a cottony scanty partial veil.",
