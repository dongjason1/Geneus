    "__SUMMARY__": "Psilocybe acutipilea is a species of mushroom in the family Hymenogastraceae. It was discovered in October 1881 in Apiahy, Sao Paulo State, Brazil by Carlos Spegazzini, and described by him as a new species of Deconica in 1889. Gastón Guzmán transferred it to Psilocybe in 1978, but Ramirez-Cruz considered it a possible synonym of Psilocybe mexicana, but the type specimen was too moldy for them to be certain.",
