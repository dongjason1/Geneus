It was described by Italian mycologist Giacomo Bresadola in 1882.\nIt has white gills and spores. They typically have rings on the stems, which in larger species are detachable and glide up and down the stem.\nLike several other species of the genus Lepiota, it contains amatoxins which may cause potentially fatal liver injury.",
