    "__SUMMARY__": "Tricholoma colossus is a mushroom of the agaric genus Tricholoma. Due to its ringed foot, it was previously classified as Armillaria, even though it is otherwise clearly tricholoma. The cap is 6–30 cm wide, brick red - chestnut brown, hemispherical when young, widening later on, uneven, always with very thick meat, surface slightly sticky, decomposing somewhat into scales. Foot is full, 2-5 (at the stem even 10) cm thick, solid. Ring-like formation at the top of the foot, above which it is white. Taste horrid, smell unclear. Grows in pine forests September–October; very rare.",
