    "__SUMMARY__": "Lactifluus clarkeae is an Australasian milk-cap mushroom. It was described as Lactarius species in 1927 by Australian naturalist John Burton Cleland and was transferred to the genus Lactifluus in 2012.The original description reads:\"Pileus 3 ins. (7.5 cm.) in diameter, infundibuliform, matt, reddish-fawn. Gills adnate, moderately close, pallid becoming spotted and discoloured brown. Stem short, µm, in. (18 mm.) high, stout (9/16 in., 16 mm.), expanded towards the pileus, attenuated downwards, solid, colour of the pileus, milk white. Taste mild. Spores slightly angular, 8 µm.\nS.A. - Mount Lofty, June, 1927. In general appearance rather resembling Russula Floctonae, Cld. et Cheel. \nFrom its resemblance to this Russula we have named it after Miss Flockton's niece, Miss Phyllis Clarke, to whom we have been so much indebted for many admirable watercolour drawings of New South Wales agarics.\"\nMcNabb noted the similarity of L. clarkeae to L. rubroviolascens from Madagascar and erected the new section Tomentosi for these two species.L. clarkeae occurs in Australia and New Zealand. In New Zealand, L. clarkeae var. clarkeae is found under shrubs of the genus Leptospermum, while var. aurantiorubra is associated with Nothofagus (southern beech).",
