    "Taxonomy": "The species was originally described as Lactarius aureifolius by Annameike Verbeken in 1996. She transferred the species to Lactifluus in 2011. It is classified in the subgenus Edules.",
    "Description": "The fruit bodies have convex caps measuring 3–12 cm (1.2–4.7 in); the margins of the cap turn upward in maturity, resulting in a funnel shape. The stem measures 1.5–5.5 cm (0.6–2.2 in) long by 1.5–3.5 cm (0.6–1.4 in) thick. The distantly spaced gills have an adnate to somewhat decurrent attachment to the stem. Spores are ellipsoidal, measuring 6.7–7.6–8.6 by 5.7–6.3–6.9 μm.",
