    "__SUMMARY__": "Amanita subjunquillea, also known as the East Asian death cap is a mushroom of the large genus Amanita, which occurs in East and Southeast Asia. Potentially deadly if ingested, it is closely related to the death cap A. phalloides.\nInitially little reported, the toxicity of A. subjunquillea has been well established; a study in Korea revealed it to have similar effects to A. phalloides, namely delayed gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatotoxicity, and a 12.5% mortality. The species killed five people out of six who ingested them in Hebei, China in 1994.An all-white variety, Amanita subjunquillea var. alba is known from southwestern China, Japan, and Northern India.",
