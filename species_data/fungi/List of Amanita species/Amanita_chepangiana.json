    "__SUMMARY__": "Amanita chepangiana, commonly known as the Chepang slender Caesar, is a species of agaric fungus in the family Amanitaceae native to China and southern Asia.\nIn part of Yunnan, China, the species is traditionally consumed, however toxicity analysis found out at least 1 type of amatoxin and phallotoxin each within the species. Together with the difficulty to distinguish against other lethal species, consumption is recommended against.",
