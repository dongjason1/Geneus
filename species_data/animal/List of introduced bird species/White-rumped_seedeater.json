    "__SUMMARY__": "The white-rumped seedeater (Crithagra leucopygia) is a species of finch in the Fringillidae family.\nIt is found in Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan and Uganda.\nIts natural habitat is dry savanna. It is known elsewhere and in aviculture as the grey singing finch. \nThe white-rumped seedeater was formerly placed in the genus Serinus but phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences found that the genus was polyphyletic. The genus was therefore split and a number of species including the white-rumped seedeater were moved to the resurrected genus Crithagra Swainson 1827.\n\n\n== References =="
