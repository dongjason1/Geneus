    "__SUMMARY__": "The yellow cardinal (Gubernatrix cristata) is a species of bird in the family Thraupidae. It is the only member of its genus, Gubernatrix.It is found in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay.\nIts natural habitats are dry savanna, temperate shrubland, subtropical or tropical moist shrubland, and temperate grassland.\nIt is threatened by habitat loss and from pet trade trappers. The main gender that is caught are the males. As such, the Yellow Cardinal is characterized as endangered due to the constant entrapment.  There was a study conducted that looked at the vocalization of the Yellow Cardinal in its habitat. It was found that there was some variation with the Common Diuca Finch.  \n\nThe current global population of Gubernatrix cristata is between 1000 and 2000 . Studies have shown that there are some genetic differences between different populations. Another study has shown that the yellow cardinal presents plasticity in song production, with small differences in song among four different populations.\n\n\n== References =="
