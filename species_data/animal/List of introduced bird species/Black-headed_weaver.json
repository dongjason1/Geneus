    "__SUMMARY__": "Not to be confused with village weaver or golden-backed weaverThe black-headed weaver (Ploceus melanocephalus), also known as yellow-backed weaver,  is a species of bird in the family Ploceidae.",
    "Taxonomy and systematics": "P. victoriae Ash, 1986 is now thought to be a hybrid between P. melanocephalus and P. castanops.",
    "Description": "Breeding males have a black head and yellow nuchal collar, which is absent in the golden-backed and Juba and golden-backed weavers. It also differs from the latter species and village weaver by its plain, greenish mantle plumage. The pale yellow underpart plumage is suffused with a variable amount of chestnut.\nThe female and non-breeding male lack the black head, and resemble a female masked weaver, except that they have dark eyes and a darker bill. Their buffy breast plumage also distinguishes them from non-breeding golden-backed weavers.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "It occurs in West, Central and East Africa, but it has also been introduced to the Iberian Peninsula. It is found in savanna and similar habitats, typically near water.",
