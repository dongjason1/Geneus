    "__SUMMARY__": "The red-eyed dove (Streptopelia semitorquata) is a dove that is a widespread and common in sub-Saharan Africa. It has been listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 2004.",
    "Description": "Red-eyed dove is a largish, stocky pigeon, typically 30 cm (12 inches) in length. Its back, wings and tail are pale brown. When flying, it shows blackish flight feathers. The head and underparts are dark vinous-pink, shading to pale grey on the face. There is a black hind neck patch edged with white. The legs and a patch of bare skin around the eye are red. The call is a loud doo-doo-du-du.\nSexes are similar, but juveniles are duller than adults, and have scalloping on the body feathers.\nRed-eyed doves eat grass seeds, grains and other vegetation. They often forage on the ground.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "It is distributed through most of sub-Saharan Africa except in desert zones. \nIt is a common, if not abundant, species in most habitats other than desert. Like several other species in this genus, they are not particularly gregarious and often feed alone or in pairs. They can be found in forests near rivers.",
    "Behaviour": "Females lay two white eggs at a time. This species builds a stick nest in a tree and lays two white eggs. Its flight is quick, with the regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings which are characteristic of pigeons in general.",
