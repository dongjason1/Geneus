    "__SUMMARY__": "The orange-fronted parakeet or orange-fronted conure (Eupsittula canicularis), also known as the half-moon conure, is a medium-sized parrot that is resident from western Mexico to Costa Rica.",
    "Taxonomy": "There are three subspecies:\nE. c. clarae – (R. T. Moore, 1937): found in west central Mexico\nE. c. eburnirostrum – (Lesson, 1842): found in southwestern Mexico\nE. c. canicularis – (Linnaeus, 1758): found from southern Mexico to western Costa Rica",
    "Description": "Orange-fronted parakeets are 22.5 cm (8.9 in) long and weigh 80 g (2.8 oz). The adult is mainly green, paler and yellower below and with an olive tone to the breast. The wings have blue outer primaries and yellow linings, and the pointed tail is tipped with blue. The head is distinctive, with a blue crown, orange forehead, bare yellow eye-ring, yellow iris and white bill. Young birds are similar to the adults, but with much less orange on the forehead.",
    "Habitat and range": "It is found in lowlands and foothills on the Pacific side of the central mountain ranges in forest canopy and edges, and more open woodland, including savanna and second growth.",
    "Behaviour": "The orange-fronted parakeet feeds in flocks which can reach 100 birds outside the breeding season, taking various seeds, flowers and fruits including figs. Its flight call is a raucous can-can-can, and when perched it has a reedy zeeweet.",
    "Behaviour-Breeding": "The 3–5 white eggs are laid in an unlined nest cavity, usually self-excavated in an arboreal termite nest of the termite species Nasutitermes nigriceps, but sometimes in an old woodpecker hole or natural cavity.",
    "Aviculture": "The population has decreased in many areas due to persecution for the pet trade.",
