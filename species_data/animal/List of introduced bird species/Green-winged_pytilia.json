    "__SUMMARY__": "The green-winged pytilia (Pytilia melba) is a common species of estrildid finch found in Africa. It has an estimated global extent of occurrence of 6,000,000 square kilometres (2,300,000 sq mi).It is widespread throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, though it is more rarely seen in central, far southern and coastal western parts of the continent. It has two subspecies groups, nominate melba in the south and the northerly citerior, which are sometimes treated as separate species. Usually, additional subspecies are recognized within these two groups.",
    "Origin": "Origin and phylogeny has been obtained by Antonio Arnaiz-Villena et al. Estrildinae may have originated in India and dispersed thereafter (towards Africa and Pacific Ocean habitats).",
