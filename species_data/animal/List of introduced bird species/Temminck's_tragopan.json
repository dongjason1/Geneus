    "__SUMMARY__": "Temminck's tragopan (Tragopan temminckii) is a medium-sized, approximately 64 cm long,  pheasant in the genus Tragopan. The male is a stocky red-and-orange bird with white-spotted plumage, black bill and pink legs. It has a bare blue facial skin, inflatable dark-blue lappet and horns. The female is a white-spotted brown bird with blue circular eye skin.\n\nIts appearance resembles the satyr tragopan, but unlike the latter species it has all red upperbody plumage and orange collar. The diet consists mainly of berries, grass and plants.\nThe Temminck's tragopan is found across the mountains of far northeast India, central China, far northern Myanmar to northwestern Tonkin.\nWidespread and a common species throughout its large habitat range, the Temminck's tragopan is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\nThis bird's common name and Latin binomial commemorate the Dutch naturalist Coenraad Jacob Temminck.",
