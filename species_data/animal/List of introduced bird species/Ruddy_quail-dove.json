    "__SUMMARY__": "The ruddy quail-dove (Geotrygon montana) is a member of the bird family Columbidae, which includes doves and pigeons.\nIt breeds throughout the West Indies, Central America, and tropical South America. It has appeared as a vagrant in Florida and southern Texas.    It lays two buff-colored eggs on a flimsy platform built on a shrub.  Some nests are built on the ground.\nThe ruddy quail-dove is approximately 19–28 cm in length.   The bird is distinguished by having a rust-colored back, facial mask and similarly colored wings.  The breast, rump and undereye stripe are lighter brown.  \nThis bird is found in woodland and scrub forest.  It also has adapted to coffee plantations.   It is somewhat sensitive to forest fragmentation.   These birds forage on the ground, mainly eating seeds.   It will also take small invertebrates in its diet.  Ruddy quail-doves feed primarily on the ground.",
