    "__SUMMARY__": "The mottled petrel (Pterodroma inexpectata) or kōrure is a species of seabird and a member of the gadfly petrels. The bird is 33 to 35 cm (13–14 in) in length with a 74 to 82 cm (29–32 in) wingspan.\nThis species is highly pelagic, rarely approaching land, except to nest and rear young.  The mottled petrel feeds mostly on fish and squid, with some crustaceans taken.  It is a transequatorial migrant, breeding in the islands of New Zealand, and migrating to the Bering Sea, concentrating in the Gulf of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands.\nThe mottled petrel uses burrows and rock crevices to nest in. It was formerly more numerous than today.  The species' numbers have been and continue to be affected by predation by introduced mammals. Chicks have been reintroduced to Maungaharuru, hills 24 km from the sea, in Hawke's Bay.",
