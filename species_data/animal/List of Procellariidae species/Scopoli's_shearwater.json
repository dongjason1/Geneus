    "__SUMMARY__": "Scopoli's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea) is a bird in the family Procellariidae formerly considered conspecific with Cory's shearwater (Calonectris borealis). It has no subspecies. The genus name Calonectris comes from Ancient Greek kalos, \"good\" and nectris, \"swimmer\". The specific diomedea refers to Diomedes, the mythical king. His wife was serially unfaithful while he fought at Troy, so he left to found a city in Italy. After his death, his distraught friends were turned into white seabirds. The English name is for Italian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli who first described the species.",
