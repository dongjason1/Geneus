    "__SUMMARY__": "The Herald petrel (Pterodroma heraldica) is a species of seabird and a member of the gadfly petrels. The bird is 35–39 cm (14–15 in) in size, with an 88–102 cm (35–40 in) wingspan.\nThe petrel has various color morphs: dark and light, as well as intermediates between the two. Found primarily in the south Pacific, it has been seen in Hawaii. It nests on oceanic islands and atolls, on cliff ledges, ridges or rocky slopes. On some islands, nesting birds are threatened by feral cats and rats.\nDue to ongoing habitat loss and small breeding range, this species is evaluated as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\nIn May 2007, a herald petrel tagged on Raine Island in 1984 was observed off the coast of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean.  This greatly increases the known life span and range of the species.Also it was recently identified as this species, from what was previously an unidentified Pterodroma species, to be breeding on Round Island, 22 kilometers north of Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean.In August 2017, Queensland Parks and Wildlife Services (QPWS) staff confirmed a herald petrel chick had hatched on Raine Island after sighting an adult herald petrel taking care of a single egg in a nest in June 2017. The sighted chick was the first time a herald petrel was seen to breed in 30 years. Raine Island is the only known Herald petrel breeding site in Australia.",
