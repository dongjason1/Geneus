    "__SUMMARY__": "Protobothrops xiangchengensis, commonly known as the Kham Plateau pitviper, is a venomous pit viper species endemic to south-central China. No subspecies are currently recognized.",
    "Taxonomy": "There is a genetic proposal to reassign this species to the genus Protobothrops, as Protobothrops xiangchengensis, because a \"phylogeny of four mitochondrial gene regions suggests a revised taxonomy for Asian pitvipers (Trimeresurus and Ovophis)\".",
    "Description": "Scalation includes 25 (23, 24) rows of dorsal scales at midbody, 175-194/181-194 ventral scales in males/females, 54-66/44-62 subcaudal scales and 7-8 (9 or 10) supralabial scales.",
