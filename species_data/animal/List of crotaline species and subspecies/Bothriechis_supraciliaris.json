    "__SUMMARY__": "Bothriechis supraciliaris, or the blotched palm-pit viper, is a species of venomous snake in the family Viperidae. The species is endemic to Costa Rica.",
    "Description": "B. supraciliaris is usually 50–60 cm (20–24 in) in total length (including tail), but can reach 80 cm (31 in). Its body colour varies. It can be either bluish-green, reddish-brown, or reddish-maroon, but usually it is bright-green or moss-green. The body is circular, ovoid and rhomboid in cross-section, with irregular dorsal blotches, that sometimes form crossbands. The belly is light. There are 21-23 dorsal scales rows at midbody. The head carries dark stripes and prominent scales that are located above the eyes. The only sexual dimorphism noted is that females of the species tend to be longer and thicker than males.",
    "Geographic range": "The geographic range of B. supraciliaris is limited to mountains near San Isidro del General, San Jose Province, Costa Rica.",
    "Taxonomy": "B. supraciliaris was formerly considered a subspecies of B. schlegelii, the eyelash palm-pitviper.",
