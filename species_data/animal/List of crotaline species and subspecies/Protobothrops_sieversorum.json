    "__SUMMARY__": "Protobothrops sieversorum, commonly known as the three-horned-scaled pitviper, is a species of venomous pit viper.",
    "Taxonomy": "Protobothrops sieversorum was originally placed in the monotypic genus Triceratolepidophis. Guo et al. (2007) synonymised this genus with the genus Protobothrops, based on evidence that it is phylogenetically nested within the existing species of that genus.",
    "Etymology": "The specific name, sieversorum (masculine, genitive, plural), is in honor of the Sievers family, father Dr. J.-H. Sievers and sons Julian Sievers and Moritz Sievers, for their support of nature conservation and zoological research.",
