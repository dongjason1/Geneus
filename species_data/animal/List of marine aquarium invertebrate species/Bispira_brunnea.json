    "__SUMMARY__": "Bispira brunnea, the social feather duster or cluster duster, is a species of marine bristleworm. They tend to live in groups of individuals, and are common off of the Caribbean islands in southeast North America. The feather duster has one crown of various colors, however, the color of the crown seems to be consistent within individual colonies. They reproduce asexually, and grow between 3–6 cm.\n\n\n== References =="
