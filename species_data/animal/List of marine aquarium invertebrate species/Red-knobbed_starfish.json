It has a gray body with red stripes that connect the tubercles. This creates an appearance of a grid made of interconnecting wires.The skeleton is composed of many calcareous ossicles and spicules. They are located inside the layer of connective tissue. This skeleton supports the large central disk.It is distributed in the western Indo-Pacific in locations ranging from shallow tidal pools to reefs up to 100 m (330 ft) deep.",
    "Behaviour and diet": "P. linckii is active in the daytime. It is a popular aquarium specimen, but is considered incompatible with many other invertebrates, as it will eat soft corals, sponges, tube worms, clams, other starfish, and the like.It is also a heavily fished species for the curios trade.",
