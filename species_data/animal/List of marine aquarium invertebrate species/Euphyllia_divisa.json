    "__SUMMARY__": "Euphyllia divisa, commonly known as frogspawn coral and sometimes misspelled Euphyllia divisia, is a large-polyped stony coral native to the Indo-Pacific islands. It is a commonly kept species in the marine aquarium hobby. The related coral Euphyllia paradivisa is frequently misidentified as frogspawn leading to some confusion. Euphyllia divisa has a corallite skeleton with a flabello-meandroid \"wall\" structure whereas Euphyllia paradivisa has a tree-like branching structure with separate coralites.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "It is native to the Indo-Pacific, Australia, Southeast Asia, the Ryukyu Islands and East China Sea, the Solomon Islands, Fiji, and Palau\n\n\n== References =="
