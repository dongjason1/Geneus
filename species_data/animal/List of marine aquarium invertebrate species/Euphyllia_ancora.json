    "__SUMMARY__": "Euphyllia ancora is a species of hard coral in the family Euphylliidae. It is known by several common names, including anchor coral and hammer coral, or less frequently as  sausage coral, ridge coral, or bubble honeycomb coral.",
    "Description": "This type of madreporial colony is easy to identify because of its puffy tubular tentacles with T-shaped tips. The coral is blue-gray to orange in color, sometimes with green on the tentacles. It can demonstrate full or partial viral infection of green fluorescent protein, a trait highly sought for aquarium specimens. Colonies are usually no more than a meter across, but at times can reach several meters.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "The anchor coral is widespread throughout the tropical waters of the Indo-West Pacific area from the Maldives to the Salomon Islands with a large presence in Indonesia. It is common in some areas, but it faces several threats that have reduced its overall population. It is overharvested for the aquarium trade. Its coral reef habitat is also degraded and destroyed in many areas.",
