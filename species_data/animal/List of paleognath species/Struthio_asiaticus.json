    "__SUMMARY__": "The Asian or Asiatic ostrich (Struthio asiaticus), is an extinct species of ostrich that ranged from Morocco, the Middle East to China and Mongolia. Fossils date from the upper Pliocene to the early Holocene (3.6 MYA - c.6000 BC or BCE). Beads made from shells taken from archaeological sites in India dating to more than 25000 years were found to have traces of DNA and analysis of sequences examined from them show that the species is definitely in the genus Struthio.\n\nAsian ostriches were widespread around Europe and Asia. They also used to live in northern Indian Subcontinent and southern Siberia. In China, it is known that Asiatic ostriches became extinct at the end or shortly after the end of the last Ice Age.",
