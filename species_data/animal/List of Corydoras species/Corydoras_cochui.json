    "__SUMMARY__": "The barredtail corydoras or Cochu's catfish (Corydoras cochui) is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the Corydoradinae sub-family of the family Callichthyidae. It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Upper Araguaia River basin in Brazil. In the system of \"C-Numbers\" developed by the German fishkeeping magazine DATZ to identify undescribed species of Corydoras in the aquarium hobby, this fish had been assigned number \"C22\" until it was correctly identified.\nThe fish will grow in length up to 1 inches (2.5 centimeters). It lives in a tropical climate in water with a 6.0 - 8.0 pH, a water hardness of 2 - 25 dGH, and a temperature of 79 °F (26 °C). It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs.\nThe barredtail corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry.",
