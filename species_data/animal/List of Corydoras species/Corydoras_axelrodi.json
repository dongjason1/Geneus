    "__SUMMARY__": "The pink corydoras (Corydoras axelrodi) is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the subfamily Corydoradinae of the family Callichthyidae. It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Meta River basin in Colombia.\nThe fish will grow in length up to 1.7 in (4.2 cm). It is an undemanding species with requirements similar to the majority of other Corydoras. Water chemistry is not especially important and temperature in the 72 – 79 °F (22 – 26 °C) range is fully sufficient. It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter.  It lays eggs in dense vegetation and adults do not guard the eggs.  The female holds 2–4 eggs between her pelvic fins, where the male fertilizes them for about 30 seconds.  Only then does the female swim to a suitable spot, where she attaches the very sticky eggs. The pair repeats this process until about 100 eggs have been fertilized and attached.\nThe pink corydoras is of commercial importance in the aquarium trade industry.",
