    "__SUMMARY__": "Adolfo's catfish (Corydoras adolfoi) is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the Corydoradinae sub-family of the family Callichthyidae. It originates in inland waters in South America, and is found in the Rio Negro basin in Brazil.  It is also known as Adolfo's cory.\nThe fish will grow in length up to 2.2 inches (5.7 centimeters). It feeds on worms, benthic crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. Data from a wild locality show temperature 78 °F (26 °C), very low pH (5,3-5,4) and conductivity 7,0-8,3 microSiemens.\nThis species is not very easy to breed in aquarium. The fish spawn in open water and 1-2 large (ca. 2 mm in diameter), sticky eggs are attached to a plant or stone. Adults do not guard the eggs. The number of eggs is relatively small (several tens per spawn from one female). The optimal water chemistry for the development of eggs varies from author to author and it may thus depend on the origin of the fish population. At 26 °C the fry hatch after ca. four days and start to eat after another four days. Raising the fry may not be fully trouble-free, however.",
