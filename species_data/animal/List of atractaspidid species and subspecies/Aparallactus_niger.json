Ventrals 164; anal plate entire; subcaudals 60.\nPortion of rostral visible from above ⅓ as long as its distance from the frontal. Internasals slightly broader than long, widely separated from the preocular. A single prefrontal, forming sutures with the nasal and the preocular. Frontal nearly 1½ times as long as broad, as long as its distance from the end of the snout, much shorter than the parietals. Nasal semidivided, in contact with the preocular. Two postoculars. A single temporal. Seven upper labials, third and fourth entering the eye, fifth and sixth in contact with the parietal. First lower labial in contact with its fellow behind the mental.
