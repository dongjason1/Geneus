    "__SUMMARY__": "Clibanarius fonticola is the only species of hermit crab in the world that lives in fresh water. It is found on the island of Espiritu Santo, Vanuatu. While a number of other hermit crabs are terrestrial or live in estuarine habitats, C. fonticola is the only species that spends its life in fresh water. It lives in a pool fed by springs near the village of Matevulu, close to an abandoned airstrip. The adult hermit crabs of this species all use shells of Clithon corona.\n\n\n== References =="
