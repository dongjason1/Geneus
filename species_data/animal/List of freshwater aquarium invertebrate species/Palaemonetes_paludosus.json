    "__SUMMARY__": "Palaemonetes paludosus, known as ghost shrimp, glass shrimp, and eastern grass shrimp, is a species of freshwater shrimp from the southeastern United States.",
    "Description": "Palaemonetes paludosus is up to 2.5 cm (1.0 in) long and largely transparent. By manipulating the pigment granules in its body, it can produce effective camouflage against its background. It is very similar to P. kadiakensis, from which it can be distinguished by the arrangement of spines on the telson.",
    "Distribution": "Palaemonetes paludosus is common in southern states east of the Appalachian Mountains. It is also found in Louisiana, where it may not be native, and there are scattered records from further west, in Texas and California.",
    "Ecology": "Palaemonetes paludosus lives in fresh water or slightly brackish water, usually in lakes. It is nocturnal, remaining hidden among the vegetation by day, and emerging at night to feed on plankton. It is an important prey item for a number of birds and fishes, and may be considered a keystone species.",
