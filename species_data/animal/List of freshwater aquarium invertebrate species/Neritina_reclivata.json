    "__SUMMARY__": "Neritina reclivata is a species of freshwater snail with an operculum, an aquatic gastropod mollusk in the family Neritidae, the nerites.\nThe common name is olive nerite, but that same common name is also used for Neritina usnea.\nNeritina reclivata is a euryhaline organism living at salinities ranging from 0 to 19 ppt. It feeds on epiphytic and epibenthic algae. It ranges from north Florida on the Atlantic Coast through the coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea to Trinidad (Russell, 1941). Neritina reclivata lives in shallow protected bays from just above high water to approximately 1.5 meters in depth where it is found on sea grasses, emergent marsh plants, rocks, and stumps. It is known to climb up marsh grass blades at high tide to avoid predators. One such predator is the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus.''",
    "Life cycle": "The life span is 3–5 years in an aquarium.",
    "Human use": "This species is used as algae-eating snail among freshwater aquarists. In an aquarium, the shell of this species grows 1.3-2.5 cm. This snail prefers an aquarium temperature of 22.2-25.6 °C.\n\n\n== References =="
