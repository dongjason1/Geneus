    "__SUMMARY__": "The Newfoundland wolf (Canis lupus beothucus) is an extinct subspecies of grey wolf that was native to Newfoundland. It is described as being a medium-sized, slender-skulled wolf with a white pelt, though melanists also occurred. In comparison to its mainland relatives it bears a striking difference in its internal accessory cusp angles allowing for distinction between subspecies. The last specimen was reportedly killed in 1911. This wolf is recognized as a subspecies of Canis lupus in the taxonomic authority Mammal Species of the World (2005).",
