    "__SUMMARY__": "The Alaskan tundra wolf (Canis lupus tundrarum), also known as the barren-ground wolf, is a subspecies of gray wolf native to the barren grounds of the Arctic coastal tundra region. This subspecies only inhabits the tundra regions along the Arctic coast of northern Alaska.\nIt was named in 1912 by Gerrit Smith Miller, who noted that it closely approaches the Great Plains wolf in skull and tooth morphology, though possessing a narrower rostrum and palate. It is a large, white-colored wolf closely resembling C. l. pambasileus, though lighter in color. This wolf is recognized as a subspecies of Canis lupus in the taxonomic authority Mammal Species of the World (2005).",
