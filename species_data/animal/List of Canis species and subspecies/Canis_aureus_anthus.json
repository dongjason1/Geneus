The ears are longer, and the head is more dog-like than that of the Egyptian wolf and measures 7 inches (17.78 cm) in length. The tail is not as hairy, and is shorter, being 10 inches (25.4 cm) long.The nose and forehead are greyish-buff, while the throat and under parts are white. It lacks the black ring round the neck, nor the stippled arrangement of black points on the back characteristic of the Egyptian wolf. The flanks and back are of a deep grey colour, grizzled with yellow. The neck is greyish-fawn, with grey predominating especially on the cheeks and below the ears. The upper muzzle, limbs, the back of the ears and tail are of a pure fawn colour, while the rest of the body is whitish.\n\n\n== References =="
