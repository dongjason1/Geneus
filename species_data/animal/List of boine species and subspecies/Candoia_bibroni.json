    "__SUMMARY__": "Common names: Bibron's bevel-nosed boa, Bibron's keel-scaled boa, Pacific tree boa, Fiji boa.Candoia bibroni is a nonvenomous boa species endemic to Melanesia and Polynesia. Two subspecies are currently recognized, including the nominate subspecies described here.",
    "Etymology": "The specific name, bibroni, is in honor of French herpetologist Gabriel Bibron.",
    "Description": "C. bibroni is the largest member of the genus Candoia; adults can grow to up to 1.5 m (5 ft) in total length (including tail). The color pattern usually consists of a pale brown, tan, or reddish brown ground color overlaid with stripes, blotches, or spots. However, some individuals have no pattern at all.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "C. bibroni is found in Melanesia and Polynesia, including the eastern Solomon Islands (Olu Malau, Ugi, Rennell, Makira, Santa Ana, Santa Cruz, Bellona, Vanikoro and Utupua), the Banks Islands (Vanua Lava Island), Vanuatu, all three of the Loyalty Islands, the Fiji Islands (Rotuma, the Yasawa Group and the Lau Group), Western Samoa (Savai'i and Upolu islands), and American Samoa (Ta'u Island).\nThe type locality given is \"l'île Viti\" (possibly Viti Levu, Fiji Islands). Jacquinot and Guichenot (1853) list the type locality as \"de l'archipel de Viti, Polynésie\".",
    "Feeding": "The Pacific tree boa hunts for food both on the ground and in the trees, preying on birds, lizards, and mammals, including bats.",
