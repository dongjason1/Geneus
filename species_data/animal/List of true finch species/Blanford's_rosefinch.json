    "__SUMMARY__": "The Blanford's rosefinch or crimson rosefinch (Agraphospiza rubescens) is a species of finch in the Fringillidae family.\nIt is found in Bhutan, China, India, and Nepal. Its natural habitat is boreal forests.\nBlanford's rosefinch was formerly placed in the genus Carpodacus with the other rosefinches. It was moved to the monotypic genus Agraphospiza  based on the results from the phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences. It differs from rosefinches in the genus Carpodacus. Both sexes have unstreaked plumage, the bill is thinner and less conical, the wings are more pointed and it has a shorter tail.Its common name commemorates the English zoologist William Thomas Blanford.\n\n\n== References =="
