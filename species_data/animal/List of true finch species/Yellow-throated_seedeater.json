    "__SUMMARY__": "The yellow-throated seedeater (Crithagra flavigula) is a species of finch in the Fringillidae family.\nIt is found only in Ethiopia.\nIts natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry shrubland and subtropical or tropical dry lowland grassland.\nIt is threatened by habitat loss.\nThe voice of the bird is a jumbled chirpy song and its call is canary like zeee-zsreee.\nThe bird favors semi-desert areas with thick patches of scrub on rocky hill sides, scattered trees in savannah type areas. It also prefers highlands rather than low lands.\nThe yellow-throated seedeater was formerly placed in the genus Serinus but phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences found that the genus was polyphyletic. The genus was therefore split and a number of species including the yellow-throated seedeater were moved to the resurrected genus Crithagra.\n\n\n== References =="
