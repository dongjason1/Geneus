    "__SUMMARY__": "The Yemen serin (Crithagra menachensis) is a species of finch in the Fringillidae family.\nIt is found in Oman, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen.\nThe Yemen serin was formerly placed in the genus Serinus but phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences found that the genus was polyphyletic. The genus was therefore split and a number of species including the Yemen serin were moved to the resurrected genus Crithagra.\n\n\n== References =="
