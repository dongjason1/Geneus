    "__SUMMARY__": "The red siskin (Spinus cucullatus) is a small passerine bird. This finch is a resident breeding bird in tropical South America in northern Colombia and northern Venezuela (where it's called \"cardenalito\"). The introduced population on Trinidad is believed to be extinct, with no sightings since 1960.\nSome hope has been given to this highly endangered species by the discovery in 2003 of a population of several thousand birds in southern Guyana, 1000 km from any previously known colony. Otherwise the world population is believed to be between 600-6000 pairs.\nThe red siskin is found in open country, forest edges and grassland with trees or shrubs. The female is believed to lay 3 greenish white eggs in a grassy cup nest in a tree. It was common in the early twentieth century, occurring throughout the foothills of northern Venezuela but has now become extremely rare in a fragmented range.\nThe red siskin is about 10 cm long. The male is mainly deep red, with black on the head, throat, flight feathers and tail tip, and a whitish lower belly and under tail. The female is grey on the head, breast, and upper parts, apart from a red rump and upper tail. The breast is grey with reddish flanks, and the rest of the underparts, the wings and tail resemble the corresponding areas of the male. Immature females are paler than the adults, and immature males are brown rather than red.\nThe call is a high-pitched chitter and sharp chi-tit like Indian silverbill, and the male's song is a musical goldfinch-like melody with twitters and trills.\nRed siskins eat seeds, and are highly gregarious. When they were more numerous they formed semi-nomadic flocks.\nThe siskin has been illegally trapped for the cage bird trade and endangered by environmental factors.  Domestication has probably been responsible for the continuation of the species, which might overwise be extinct. This is an attractive finch with a pleasant song, and its unique coloration for a small finch (most are predominantly yellow) has led to it being used for interbreeding with domesticated canaries to produce varieties with red in the plumage.\nResearchers at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute lead a program, the Red Siskin Initiative, with the goals of uncovering more about this species and preventing its extinction.",
