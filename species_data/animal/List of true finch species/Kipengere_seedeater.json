    "__SUMMARY__": "The Kipengere seedeater (Crithagra melanochrous), also known as the Tanzania seedeater, is a species of finch in the Fringillidae family.  It is found only in Tanzania.  Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist montane forests and subtropical or tropical high-altitude shrubland.  It is threatened by habitat loss.\nThe Kipengere seedeater was formerly placed in the genus Serinus but phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences found that the genus was polyphyletic. The genus was therefore split and a number of species including the Kipengere seedeater were moved to the resurrected genus Crithagra.",
    "Range": "The Kipengere seedeater is found in montane forests and shrublands in the Udzungwa Mountains, Kipengere Range, and Mount Rungwe.\n\n\n== References =="
