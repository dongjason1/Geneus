    "__SUMMARY__": "Reichenow's seedeater (Crithagra reichenowi) is a species of finch in the Fringillidae family.  It is sometimes considered conspecific with the black-throated canary.\nThe Reichenow's seedeater was formerly placed in the genus Serinus but phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences found that the genus was polyphyletic. The genus was therefore split and a number of species including the Reichenow's seedeater were moved to the resurrected genus Crithagra.",
    "Distribution": "It is found frequently in eastern Africa.\nIts natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests, dry savanna, and subtropical or tropical dry shrubland.\n\n\n== References =="
