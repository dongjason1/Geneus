    "__SUMMARY__": "The black-eared seedeater (Crithagra mennelli) is a species of finch in the Fringillidae family.\nIt is found in Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.\nIts natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests and dry savanna.\nThe black-eared seedeater was formerly placed in the genus Serinus but phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences found that the genus was polyphyletic. The genus was therefore split and a number of species including the black-eared seedeater were moved to the resurrected genus Crithagra.",
