    "__SUMMARY__": "The Reichard's seedeater (Crithagra reichardi) is a species of finch in the Fringillidae family.\nIt is found in Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, South Sudan, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.\nIts natural habitat is dry savanna.\nIt is named after the German explorer Paul Reichard.Reichard's seedeater was formerly placed in the genus Serinus but phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences found that the genus was polyphyletic. The genus was therefore split and a number of species including Reichard's seedeater were moved to the resurrected genus Crithagra.\n\n\n== References =="
