    "__SUMMARY__": "The Kauaʻi ʻamakihi (Chlorodrepanis stejnegeri) is a species of Hawaiian honeycreeper endemic to Kauaʻi. Birds of both sexes are greenish-yellow with black lores and a large, sickle-shaped, downcurved beak. The beak is larger than that of the other three ʻamakihi species and occasionally leads to misidentification as a Kauaʻi nukupuʻu, which is thought to be extinct. Like other honeycreepers, the Kauaʻi ʻamakihi is threatened by habitat loss, invasive species, and avian malaria, but has not been affected as strongly as other species in the subfamily.",
