    "__SUMMARY__": "The northern grosbeak-canary or Abyssinian grosbeak canary (Crithagra donaldsoni) is a species of passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae. It is found in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia. Its binomial name commemorates the explorer Arthur Donaldson Smith.\nThe northern grosbeak-canary was formerly placed in the genus Serinus but phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences found that the genus was polyphyletic. The genus was therefore split and a number of species including the northern grosbeak-canary were moved to the resurrected genus Crithagra.",
