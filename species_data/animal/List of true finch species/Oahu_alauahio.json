    "__SUMMARY__": "The O'ahu 'alauahio (Paroreomyza maculata), also known as the Oahu creeper, is a small finch-like Hawaiian honeycreeper that is endemic to the Hawaiian island of Oahu.",
    "Description": "It is a small, yellow green bird with a bluish bill. It is 4 inches (100 mm) long and is green on the back and tail. The head and underparts are yellow. The face is a brighter yellow with a dark green eyestripe. Juveniles are browner with white wingbars. It feeds on invertebrates hidden under the bark of trees, and it uses its bill to remove the bark and catch the insects using its specialized tongue.\nThe bird is critically endangered and may be extinct because of disease (avian malaria), introduced and invasive plants and wildlife, and habitat loss. The last confirmed record occurred in 1985, though unconfirmed reports are still filed.",
