    "__SUMMARY__": "The Pallas's rosefinch (Carpodacus roseus) is a species of bird in the finch family Fringillidae.\nIt is found in China, Japan, Kazakhstan, North Korea, South Korea, Mongolia, and Russia. Birds are occasionally reported from further west and there are records from several European countries, including Britain, but the cage-bird trade makes the origin of some such birds hard to assess.\nIts natural habitats are boreal forests and boreal shrubland.",
    "Description": "The Pallas's rosefinch is around 16–17.5cm in length. They are a medium to large sized, slender rosefinch with a long notched tail.\n\n\n== References =="
