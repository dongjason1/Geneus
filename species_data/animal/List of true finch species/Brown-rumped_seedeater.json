    "__SUMMARY__": "The brown-rumped seedeater (Crithagra tristriatus) is a species of finch in the Fringillidae family.\nIt is found in the highlands of Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia.\nIt is widespread in towns, villages gardens, plantations and upland heath.The brown-rumped seedeater was formerly placed in the genus Serinus but phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences found that the genus was polyphyletic. The genus was therefore split and a number of species including the brown-rumped seedeater were moved to the resurrected genus Crithagra.",
    "Description": "Length 13 cm. This is a drab uniform grey-brown canary with a small white supercilium. It has a plain (not streaked or spotted) breast with white under the chin. The uniformity of its drabness means its eponymous 'brown rump' is often not apparent.",
