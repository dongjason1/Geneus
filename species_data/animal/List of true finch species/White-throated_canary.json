    "__SUMMARY__": "The white-throated canary (Crithagra albogularis) is a species of finch in the Fringillidae family.",
    "Taxonomy": "The white-throated canary was formerly placed in the genus Serinus but phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences found that the genus was polyphyletic. The genus was therefore split and a number of species including the white-throated canary were moved to the resurrected genus Crithagra.",
    "Description": "The white-throated canary is a small bird about 15 cm long with generally dull-coloured plumage and a yellow or yellow-green rump. It has a heavy horn-coloured beak and brown irises. Its legs are brown. The male and female have similar external appearances, and juveniles resemble adults.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "It is found in Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, and South Africa. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry shrubland and subtropical or tropical high-altitude grassland.",
