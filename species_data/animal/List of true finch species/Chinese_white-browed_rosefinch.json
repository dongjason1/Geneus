    "__SUMMARY__": "The Chinese white-browed rosefinch (Carpodacus dubius) is a true finch species (family Fringillidae).\nIt is found in central China and eastern Tibet. Its natural habitats are temperate forests and temperate shrubland.\nThis species was at one time considered as a subspecies of the Himalayan white-browed rosefinch (Carpodacus thura) but was up-ranked to species status. This was supported  by a phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences.",
