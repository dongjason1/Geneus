    "__SUMMARY__": "The great rosefinch (Carpodacus rubicilla) is a species of finch in the Fringillidae family. It is found in Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan and east to China.  Its natural habitats are tundra and temperate grassland.\nWhile past taxonomies treated the C. r. severtzovi and two other subspecies as a separate species, the spotted great rosefinch (and called the nominate subspecies the \"Caucasian great rosefinch\"), they now usually considered subspecies of the great rosefinch.\nFour subspecies are recognised:\nC. r. rubicilla - (Güldenstädt, 1775) - central and eastern Caucasus Mountains\nC. r. diabolicus - (Koelz, 1939) - northeastern Afghanistan and Tajikistan\nC. r. kobdensis - (Sushkin, 1925) - southern Siberia, western Mongolia and northwestern China\nC. r. severtzovi - Sharpe, 1886 - eastern Kazakhstan to central China, the Himalayas and northern Pakistan - the spotted great rosefinch\n\n\n== References =="
