    "__SUMMARY__": "The yellow-browed seedeater (Crithagra whytii) is a species of finch in the Fringillidae family. It is found in Malawi, Tanzania, and Zambia.\nThe yellow-browed seedeater was formerly placed in the genus Serinus but phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences found that the genus was polyphyletic. The genus was therefore split and a number of species including the yellow-browed seedeater were moved to the resurrected genus Crithagra.",
