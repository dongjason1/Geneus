    "Distribution": "It is found frequently in Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Kenya, Lesotho, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.\nIts natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests, dry savanna, and subtropical or tropical dry shrubland.",
    "Taxonomy": "The black-throated canary was formerly placed in the genus Serinus but phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences found that the genus was polyphyletic. The genus was therefore split and a number of species including the black-throated canary were moved to the resurrected genus Crithagra.",
