    "__SUMMARY__": "For the bird alternatively named yellow-rumped seedeater, see black-throated canary, Serinus atrogularis\n\nThe yellow-rumped seedeater, yellow-rumped serin or Abyssinian yellow-rumped seedeater (Crithagra xanthopygius) is a species of finch in the Fringillidae family.\nIt is found in Eritrea and Ethiopia.\nIts natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry shrubland.\nThe yellow-rumped seedeater was formerly placed in the genus Serinus but phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences found that the genus was polyphyletic. The genus was therefore split and a number of species including the yellow-rumped seedeater were moved to the resurrected genus Crithagra.\n\n\n== References =="
