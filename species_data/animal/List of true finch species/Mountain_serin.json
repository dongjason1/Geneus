    "__SUMMARY__": "The mountain serin (Chrysocorythus estherae) is a species of finch in the Fringillidae family.\nIt is found in Indonesia and the Philippines. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist montane forests and subtropical or tropical high-altitude grassland.\nThe mountain serin was formerly placed in the genus Serinus but a phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences found that the species was not closely related to other member of Serinus nor to the geographically nearest finch, the Vietnamese greenfinch but to the European Goldfinch Carduelis carduelis and to the Citril Finch Carduelis citrinella.  The species was therefore assigned to a separate genus Chrysocorythus, a name that had previously been proposed by the German ornithologist Hans Edmund Wolters in 1967.\n\n\n== References =="
