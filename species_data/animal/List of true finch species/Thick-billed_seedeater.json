    "__SUMMARY__": "The thick-billed seedeater (Crithagra burtoni) is a species of finch in the Fringillidae family.  It is found in Angola, Burundi, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda.\nThe thick-billed seedeater was formerly placed in the genus Serinus but phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences found that the genus was polyphyletic. The genus was therefore split and a number of species including the thick-billed seedeater were moved to the resurrected genus Crithagra.\n\n\n== References =="
