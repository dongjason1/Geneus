    "__SUMMARY__": "The white-bellied canary (Crithagra dorsostriatus) is a species of finch in the Fringillidae family.\nIt is found in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda.\nIts natural habitat is dry savanna.\nThe white-bellied canary was formerly placed in the genus Serinus but phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences found that the genus was polyphyletic. The genus was therefore split and a number of species including the white-bellied canary were moved to the resurrected genus Crithagra.\n\n\n== References =="
