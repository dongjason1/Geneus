    "__SUMMARY__": "The black-faced canary (Crithagra capistratus) is a species of finch in the Fringillidae family.\nIt is found in Angola, Burundi, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, and Zambia.\nIts natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical moist shrubland.\nThe black-faced canary was formerly placed in the genus Serinus but phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences found that the genus was polyphyletic. The genus was therefore split and a number of species including the black-faced canary were moved to the resurrected genus Crithagra.\n\n\n== References =="
