    "__SUMMARY__": "The two-lined blind snake (Tetracheilostoma bilineatum) is a harmless blind snake species endemic to Martinique in the Lesser Antilles.",
    "Distribution": "Though previously recorded on St. Lucia and Barbados, specimens identified to those islands were described in 2008 as separate species, L. breuili and L. carlae.  A specimen identified as from Guadeloupe was reported by Duméril and Bibron (1844:331), but none are known from that island. The type locality given is \"Vaterland Martinique.\"",
    "Description": "It is dark brown with two yellow stripes along its sides.  It was once known as the world's smallest snake, being small enough to slither through a pencil if the lead were removed.  Its typical length is 11 cm (4.5 in). However, the newly described L. carlae (Hedges, 2008) is reported to be even smaller.",
