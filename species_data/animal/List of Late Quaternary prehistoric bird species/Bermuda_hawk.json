    "__SUMMARY__": "The Bermuda hawk was the sole member of the genus Bermuteo. The Bermuda hawk inhabited the island of Bermuda where it is recorded in the fossil record and is thought to account for a report of sightings of raptors made on the island in 1603 by Diego Ramírez, which states\n\n   very handsome sparrow-hawks, \n     so stupid that we even clubbed them\n\nThe species apparently was not present in 1623, when Captain John Smith noted that there were only migrant raptors not resident on Bermuda. Its date of extinction is not known but is presumed to have followed the human settlement on the island in the 17th century and may have been due to hunting and the introduction of invasive species.\n\n\n== References =="
