    "__SUMMARY__": "The Ampoza ground roller (Brachypteracias langrandi) was a species of bird in the ground roller family Brachypteraciidae. It is known only from a single humerus fossil discovered in 1929 in southwest Madagascar. Little is known about the species, but it is suggested that the bird's habitat becoming more arid was a contributing factor in its demise.",
    "Taxonomy and systematics": "The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek brakhupteros, meaning short-winged. The species was named in honour of Olivier Langrand, an ornithologist who had worked in Madagascar.\n\n\n== References =="
