    "__SUMMARY__": "The New Caledonian snipe (Coenocorypha neocaledonica) is an extinct species of austral snipe described from late Holocene cave deposits of New Caledonia. Although austral snipe are small birds, the endemic New Caledonian form was larger than all its congeners, with the exception of the Viti Levu snipe (C. miratropica). Examination of its wing bones suggest that it was a relatively strong flier. It became extinct within about 1000 years of human settlement of the island, probably as a result of predation by introduced rats. The specific epithet is a latinisation of the name of its island home.\n\n\n== References =="
