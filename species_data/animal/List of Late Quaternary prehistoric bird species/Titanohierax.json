    "__SUMMARY__": "Titanohierax gloveralleni is an extinct giant hawk known from fossils found in Cuba, Hispaniola and the Bahamas.  Titanohierax was a giant hawk with a measured fore-claw length of 57 mm (2.2 in) and an estimated weight of around 7.3 kg (16 lb), making roughly equal in size to the females of the largest living eagles.This raptor lived in the Antilles, where it was probably an apex predator.\nThe extinct crab-hawk Buteogallus borrasi was formerly placed in this genus with T. gloveralleni.  T. gloveralleni's closest living relatives are the modern, still-extant species of crab-hawks in Buteogallus.",
