    "__SUMMARY__": "The Malagasy lapwing (Vanellus madagascariensis) is an extinct wader in the lapwing family. It is known only from two subfossil humeri found in separate localities in south-western Madagascar which were described by Steven M. Goodman. Radiocarbon dating has indicated that the species became extinct in the 14th century during a period of climatic aridification.\n\n\n== References =="
