    "__SUMMARY__": "Scolopax anthonyi, the Puerto Rican woodcock, is an extinct species of woodcock in the family Scolopacidae that was once endemic to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. Fossil remains were initially identified as belonging to a snipe of the genus Gallinago, but a re-analysis of the bones in 1976 indicated that they belonged to a woodcock. It has more osteological similarities to Old World woodcock species than American woodcock species, a trait it shares with the extinct Hispaniolan woodcock (Scolopax brachycarpa). Both of these woodcocks may have belonged to a distinctive Caribbean insular radiation of woodcocks, all of which are now extinct.Scolopax anthonyi had reduced wings compared to other species in the genus, indicating that it may have had a more terrestrial lifestyle. It likely lived in a forested habitat, as with extant members of the genus. Little is known about the cause for its extinction.\n\n\n== References =="
