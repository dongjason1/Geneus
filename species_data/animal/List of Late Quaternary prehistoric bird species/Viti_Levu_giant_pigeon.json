    "__SUMMARY__": "The Viti Levu giant pigeon or Fiji giant ground pigeon (Natunaornis gigoura) is an extinct flightless pigeon of Viti Levu, the largest island in Fiji. It was only slightly smaller than the dodo (Raphus cucullatus) and Rodrigues solitaire (Pezophaps solitaria) and is the first giant, flightless pigeon to be discovered on a Pacific island.\nRemains of this species were discovered in Quaternary (probably Holocene) deposits in October 1998. Its first description was published in 2001. The holotype is in the collection of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.The generic name \"Natunaornis\" is named after Natuna, the oldest chief of the Volivoli people in the Sigatoka Valley, wherein the fossil bones of the type species were first found.  The specific name reflects both the large size of this fossil species and its proposed affinities to the crowned pigeons of genus Goura.",
