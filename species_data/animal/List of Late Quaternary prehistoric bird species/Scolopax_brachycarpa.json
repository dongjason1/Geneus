    "__SUMMARY__": "Scolopax brachycarpa, the Hispaniolan woodcock, is an extinct species of woodcock in the family Scolopacidae that was endemic to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belonged to an insular radiation of woodcocks that may have once existed throughout the Greater Antilles; another known member of this radiation is the extinct Puerto Rican woodcock (Scolopax anthonyi). Both birds shared more osteological characteristics with the Eurasian woodcock (S. rusticola) than the American woodcock (S. minor). \nIt was described from Trouing Jean Paul, a late Holocene limestone cave in Haiti, and was the fourth most common species in the fossil assemblage collected from it. The fossils collected date to between 600 and 1600 years ago, which is over 5 millennia after the first Paleo-Indian presence on Hispaniola. Thus, S. brachycarpa may have survived the Amerindian colonization of Hispaniola and possibly even into the European colonization of the island, as scientific knowledge of the island's avifauna did not rigorously start until the 19th century, at which point S. brachycarpa may have been already wiped out by invasive species.\n\n\n== References =="
