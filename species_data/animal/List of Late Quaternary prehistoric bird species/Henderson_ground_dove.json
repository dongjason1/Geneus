    "__SUMMARY__": "The Henderson ground dove (Pampusana leonpascoi), or Henderson Island ground dove, is an extinct species of bird in the family Columbidae. It was described from Holocene to possibly Late Pleistocene-aged subfossil remains found on Henderson Island in the Pitcairn Group in 1991. Its relatively small wings suggest it was flightless.\n\n\n== References =="
