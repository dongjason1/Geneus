    "__SUMMARY__": "The Bennu heron (Ardea bennuides) is a large extinct heron from the United Arab Emirates. Its remains have been dated to the Umm al-Nar period (2500 – 2000 BCE). It is thought to have been the inspiration for the Bennu in Egyptian mythology, hence the specific name.\n\n\n== References =="
