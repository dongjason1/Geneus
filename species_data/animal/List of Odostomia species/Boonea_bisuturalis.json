The species is one of eleven known species within the Boonea genus of gastropods.This species is  ectoparasitic (an external parasite) on various bivalves and other gastropods. It is notorious as a pest on oyster beds.  Its preferred hosts are the common periwinkle Littorina littorea, the mud snail Tritia obsoleta and the eastern oyster  Crassostrea virginica",
    "Description": "The length of the shell varies between 2.8 mm and 5.8 mm. The smooth shell has a light brownish epidermis. The 5-6 whorls of the teleoconch show an impressed revolving line below the suture. The periphery is obtusely angulated.",
    "Distribution": "This marine species occurs off Gulf of St Lawrence, Canada, and can exceed distribution throughout marine areas ranging from Canada to the state of Delaware, USA. The species is also notable within the Gulf of Maine.",
