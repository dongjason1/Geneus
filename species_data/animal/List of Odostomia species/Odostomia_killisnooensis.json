The six whorls of the teleoconch are evenly, moderately rounded, with very faintly shouldered summits. The spiral sculpture is strong, marked by numerous, fairly strong, equal and equally closely spaced, wavy, spiral striations ( = grooves), and fine retractive lines of growth. The periphery and the base of the body whorl are well rounded and marked like the spire. The sutures are well impressed. The aperture is ovate, somewhat effuse anteriorly. The posterior angle is acute. The outer lip is thin. The columella is very oblique The columellar fold is decidedly posterior to the middle of the columella.,posterior two-thirds straight, and strongly reflected, the anterior third strongly curved.
