    "Description": "The length of the shell varies between 3 mm and 8 mm. The shell consists of almost stright-sided whorls with deep, flat sutures. Its shell, marked with \"thick, flat, slightly sinuous, oblique costae\" that are \"indistinct on the first whorl\" and prominent thereafter, has a milky-white colour, on which the Turbonilla lactea species name is based.",
    "Distribution": "This species occurs in the following locations:",
    "Notes": "Additional information regarding this species:\nSynonymy: It is unclear why some British authors (e.g. Winckworth, 1932; Graham, 1971; McKay & Smith, 1979) prefer the junior synonym Turbonilla elegantissima (Montagu, 1803).",
