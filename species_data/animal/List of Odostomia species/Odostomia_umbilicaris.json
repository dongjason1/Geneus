    "__SUMMARY__": "Odostomia umbilicaris is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Pyramidellidae, the pyrams and their allies.",
    "Description": "The white shell is thin, transparent, and very glossy.  The length measures 2.5 millimetres (0.1 in). The five to six whorls of the teleoconch have deep sutures. The  umbilicus is very distinct, but small. The columellar tooth is small, but prominent. Owing to the transparency of the whorls, the periphery of each appears like a narrow band round the top of the succeeding one.",
