    "Description": "The large shell large measures 7.5 mm. It is umbilicated, yellowish-white. The nuclear whorls are decollated. The six post-nuclear whorls are decidedly, slopingly, tabulatedly shouldered at the summit, otherwise moderately rounded. They are marked by fine incremental lines and numerous, equal and equally spaced, slender, wavy, spiral threads, of which 6 occur upon the shoulder, and about 40 between the shoulder and the suture. The periphery and the moderately long base of the body whorl is well rounded, marked like the spire. The  ear-shaped aperture is moderately large. The posterior angle is obtuse. The inner lip is moderately long, stout, curved, somewhat reflected, provided with a strong fold a little anterior to its insertion. The parietal wall is glazed with a thin callus.",
