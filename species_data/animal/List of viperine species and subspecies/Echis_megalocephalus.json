    "__SUMMARY__": "Echis megalocephalus is a venomous viper species endemic to one island in the Red Sea off the coast of Eritrea. No subspecies are currently recognized.\nCommon names: big-headed carpet viper, Cherlin's saw-scaled viper.",
    "Description": "It grows to a total length (body + tail) of 54–62 cm (21–24 in). The head scalation is similar to that of E. pyramidum, although it is relatively large overall in comparison to other Echis species. Midbody, there are 31 rows of dorsal scales. The ventrals number 186-202, and the subcaudals 33-37. The color pattern varies, but generally consists of a series of pale, oblique, dorsal blotches set against a darker ground color.",
    "Geographic range": "It is known only from the type locality, Nokra (Nocra) Island, which is part of the Dahlak Archipelago, off the coast of Eritrea in the Red Sea.",
