This species is parapatric or slightly sympatric with M. wagneri in the Aras river valley, Kars Province, eastern Turkey.\nThe type locality is listed as \"Kasikoparan in Armenien \". According to Nilson and Andrén (1986), Kasikoparan, Armenia (40°02'N, 43°26'E) is now part of Turkey (Kazikkiran [Kazikkoparan]), Tuzluca, Kars Province, northeastern Anatolia).",
