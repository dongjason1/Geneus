    "__SUMMARY__": "Morelia spilota, commonly referred to as the carpet python or diamond python, is a large snake of the family Pythonidae found in Australia, New Guinea (Indonesia and Papua New Guinea), Bismarck Archipelago, and the northern Solomon Islands. Many subspecies are described: ITIS lists six, the Reptile Database seven, and the IUCN eight.",
    "Description": "Morelia spilota is a large species of python in the genus, reaching between 2 and 4 m (6.6 and 13.1 ft) in length and weighing up to 15 kg (33 lb). M. s. mcdowelli is the largest subspecies, regularly attaining lengths of 2.7–3 m (8.9–9.8 ft). M. s. variegata is the smallest subspecies, typically 120–180 cm (3.9–5.9 ft) in length. The average adult length is roughly 2 m (6.6 ft). However, one 3-year-old captive male M. s. mcdowelli, measured in Ireland, was found to exceed 396 cm (12.99 ft). Males are typically smaller than females; in some regions, females are up to four times heavier. The head is triangular with a conspicuous row of thermoreceptive labial pits.\nThe colouring of M. spilota is highly variable, ranging from olive to black with white or cream and gold markings. The patterning may be roughly diamond-shaped or have intricate markings made up of light and dark bands on a background of gray or a version of brown.",
    "Reproduction": "The species is oviparous, with females laying 10–50 eggs at a time. Afterward, females coil around the eggs to protect them and keep them warm through using muscular contractions to generate heat. This type of maternal care, which is typical for pythons, ceases once the hatchlings have emerged.",
    "Behaviour": "Described as semiarboreal, they are largely nocturnal, climbing trees and shrubs, and crossing open areas such as rock faces, forest floors, and even roads. However, basking behaviour is commonly observed.",
    "Diet": "Carpet pythons kill prey by constriction. Their diet consists mainly of small mammals, birds, and lizards. Incidents of carpet pythons devouring domestic cats and small dogs have been reported.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "The species is found throughout mainland Australia, with the exception of the arid centre and the western regions. It is widely distributed throughout the forest regions of Southwest Australia.  It is also found in Indonesia (southern Western New Guinea in Merauke Regency), Papua New Guinea (southern Western Province, the Port Moresby area of Central Province), and on Yule Island. The type locality given is \"Nouvelle-Hollande\" [Australia].It occurs in a wide variety of habitats, from the rainforests of northeastern Queensland (M. s. cheynei) through the River Red Gum/Riverbox woodlands of the Murray and Darling Rivers (M. s. metcalfei), to the arid, treeless islands of the Nuyts Archipelago off the South Australian west coast (M. s. imbricata). It is often found near human habitation, where it performs a useful service by eating rats and other vermin. M. spilota is known to occur in areas that receive snowfall. It is a semiarboreal tree snake; it does not completely rely on trees, however, and is capable of moving around elsewhere. It is also found in temperate grasslands with hot and dry weather.",
    "Conservation": "M. spilota is not threatened as a species. The nominate subspecies, M. s. spilota, is listed as threatened with extinction in Victoria. The subspecies M. s. imbricata is regarded as near threatened in Western Australia, due to loss of habitat.",
    "Captivity": "This species is a popular pet among snake enthusiasts. Some forms can be more irascible than others, such as M. s. mcdowelli and M. s. variegata. Forms that tend to be more even tempered include M. s. spilota and M. s. metcalfei.  Although they can grow to a reasonable size (2.0 to 3.5 m) and can be nippy as hatchlings, most  grow into docile adults. However, care must be taken when feeding, as these snakes have a strong \"feeding response\" behaviour that can be mistaken for aggression. Captive specimens are normally fed live or frozen (defrosted to room temperature) rats. They may have a lifespan of 15 to 20 years.\nThe care requirements can be generalized for all subspecies. The subspecies M. s. spilota, the cold-weather diamond python, has some separate requirements and habits.",
    "Subspecies": "The geographic distribution and common names can summarized as:",
    "Naming and taxonomy": "The first description of M. spilota was by Lacépède (1804), who placed it in the genus Coluber as Coluber spilotus. The species has since been described by various authors as containing a number of subspecies and hybrids, these have also been known by various informal names. The attempted arrangement of taxa in this, and other, Australasian Pythonidae has produced numerous synonyms. The discreet and roaming habits of this species have produced a low number of recorded specimens, giving inadequate sample numbers to support descriptions of a taxon's morphology. This is the case with proposed names which are sometimes cited, such as the Papuan Morelia spilota harrisoni (Hoser), despite being unaccepted or invalid. Common names are regional variants of carpet and diamond python or snake.The following is an incomplete list of synonyms:\n[Coluber] Arges - Linnaeus, 1758\n[Coluber] Argus - Linnaeus, 1766\nColuber spilotus - Lacépède, 1804\n[Python] punctatus - Merrem, 1820\n[Coluber (Natrix)] Argus - Merrem, 1820\n[Vipera (Echidna)] Spilotes - Merrem, 1820\nPython Peronii - Wagler, 1828\nPython spilotes - Gray In G.
