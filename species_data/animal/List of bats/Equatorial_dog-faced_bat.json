    "__SUMMARY__": "The equatorial dog-faced bat (Molossops aequatorianus) is a species of bat in the family Molossidae. It is endemic to Ecuador. They are found in dry, tropical forests. The species is now endangered. The equatorial dog-faced bat feeds on insects.",
    "Discovery and etymology": "This species was discovered by Spanish zoologist Marcos Jiménez de la Espada in November 1864. Espada encountered four females in Babahoyo, Ecuador near the Guayas River in the crack of an old tree, roosting with harmless serotine bats. It was described by Ángel Cabrera in 1917.\nIts species name aequatorianus is derived from the Latin word aequatoriensis, meaning \"Ecuadorian.\"",
    "Range and habitat": "This species is found in dry, tropical forests in west central Ecuador.\nIt has only been found in two locations.",
    "Conservation": "The IUCN assessed this species as vulnerable in 1996 and 2008. In 2016, its status was revised to endangered.\nThey are listed as endangered because they occur at fewer than five locations, and a decline is projected in their area and quality of habitat.\nIts extent of occurrence is estimated at 4,000 km2 (1,500 sq mi).\nThreats facing this species include habitat destruction, as their habitat is being converted for agricultural usage.\nPopulations that occur in swampy areas are under threat from aquaculture.\n\n\n== References =="
