    "__SUMMARY__": "The Campo-Ma’an fruit bat is a species of bat found in Cameroon. The first individual encountered was in 2007. It was described as a new species in 2014. Only three individuals have ever been encountered.",
    "Taxonomy and etymology": "It joins the short-palated fruit bat as a member of the genus Casinycteris. It has been suggested that Pohle's fruit bat should be moved from its current genus Scotonycteris to this genus as well. It differs from other bats of the Casinycteris and Scotonycteris genera by its intermediate body mass and skull morphology. The species name campomaanensis is a reference to Campo Ma'an National Park, which is close to where the first individual was found.",
    "Description": "They weigh approximately 49 g (1.7 oz) and have forearm lengths of 73.2 mm (2.88 in).\nTheir dorsal fur is rusty brown in color, while their ventral side is a lighter brown.\nTheir throats, breasts, and bellies are whitish.\nThey have several white markings on their face, such as a spot on the top of the snout, a chevron from the outer corner of each eye, a broad band around the lips, and an indistinct tuft in front of each ear.\nThe skin of the snout is greenish-yellow with the exception of the nostrils, which are distinctly reddish.\nTheir upper and lower eyelids are also greenish-yellow.\nThe patagium of the wings is brown, while their finger joints are yellow.\nThey lack a tail.\nThey have 28 teeth in total, with a dental formula of 2.1.2.12.1.3.2.\nThey have robust skulls with pronounced zygomatic arches.",
    "Range and habitat": "This species is found in the Atlantic Equatorial coastal forests, an ecoregion of Central Africa. This region is hilly, with elevation ranging from 0–500 m (0–1,640 ft) above sea level. It is thought that at least some of the bat's habitat occurs in Campo Ma'an National Park, which is protected land.\nSo far, it has been definitively identified in Cameroon, although a bat specimen collected in the past could mean that it is also present in Republic of the Congo. It has possibly been identified in Nigeria as well.",
    "Conservation": "As nothing is known about its range size, population number, or population trend, the IUCN lists it as data deficient.\n\n\n== References =="
