    "__SUMMARY__": "The hairy slit-faced bat (Nycteris hispida) is a species of slit-faced bat widely distributed throughout forests and savannas in Africa. Two recognized subspecies exist: N. h. hispida and N. h. pallida. Various forest populations in western and central Africa may be a separate species, although that has not been positively identified as of 2007.\n\n\n== References =="
