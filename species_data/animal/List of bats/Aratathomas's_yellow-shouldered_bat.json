    "__SUMMARY__": "Aratathomas's yellow-shouldered bat (Sturnira aratathomasi) is a species of bat in the family Phyllostomidae. It is found in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela.",
    "Taxonomy and etymology": "It was described as a new species in 1968.\nThe first documentation of the species, however, had occurred almost 100 years prior in 1874.\nThe authors received the specimens from Andrew Arata and Maurice Thomas—the species name \"aratathomasi\" is a portmanteau of their respective last names.",
    "Description": "In 1987, this species was called one of the largest frugivorous New World bat species, as well as the largest member of its genus (Sturnira has been expanded since then, though).\nIndividuals weigh 46.8–53 g (1.65–1.87 oz).\nIts fur is dark gray in color.\nIts dental formula is 2.1.2.32.1.2.3 for a total of 32 teeth.",
    "Biology and ecology": "Its diet likely consists of fruit, pollen, and nectar.",
    "Range and habitat": "It is found in association with the Andes in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela.\nIt is found at generally high altitudes from 1,650–3,165 m (5,413–10,384 ft) above sea level.",
    "Conservation": "As of 2016, it is evaluated as a least-concern species by the IUCN.\nIt meets the qualifications for this category because it has a wide geographic range and does not appear to be in rapid decline.\nIt is threatened by agricultural conversion to grow opium poppies.\n\n\n== References =="
