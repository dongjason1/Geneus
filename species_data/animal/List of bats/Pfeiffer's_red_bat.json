    "__SUMMARY__": "Pfeiffer's red bat (Lasiurus pfeifferi) is a species of bat from the family Vespertilioninae and is endemic to Cuba. It is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN Red List due to a significant population decline, caused by human population density on its endemic island, habitat conversion, and hurricanes. The species is probably insectivorous; fecal matter samples from a single bat contained only beetles. It may be a subspecies of the Seminole bat.",
