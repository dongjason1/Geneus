    "__SUMMARY__": "The Mexican dog-faced bat (Cynomops mexicanus) is a bat species of the family Molossidae from Central America. It is found from Nayarit in Mexico to Costa Rica at elevations up to 1500 m. It was formerly considered a subspecies of C. greenhalli. It roosts in deciduous and evergreen forest, and is usually found near small bodies of water.",
    "Taxonomy and etymology": "It was described as a subspecies of Greenhall's dog-faced bat (Cynomops greenhalli) in 1967 by Jones and Genoways.\nAt the time, Greenhall's dog-faced bat was in the genus Molossops, so the Mexican dog-faced bat initially had the trinomen Molossops greenhalli mexicanus.\nWhen Cynomops was recognized as a valid genus rather than a subgenus of Molossops, Greenhall's dog-faced bat became part of the new genus.\nHowever, it wasn't until 2002 that the Mexican dog-faced bat was promoted to full species status.\nIt is the most basal member of Cynomops.\nIts species name \"mexicanus\" is Latin meaning \"from Mexico.\"",
    "Description": "It is a relatively large free-tailed bat. Total length is 90–107 mm (3.5–4.2 in); forearms and tails are 34.6–36.8 mm (1.36–1.45 in) and 28–33 mm (1.1–1.3 in) long, respectively. It weighs 16.2–16.5 g (0.57–0.58 oz). Fur color is dark brown or reddish brown overall, but lighter on the stomach.",
    "Biology": "It is nocturnal, and roosts in sheltered places during the day such as inside hollow trees.",
