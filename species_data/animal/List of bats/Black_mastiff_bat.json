The fur of its back is usually shorter than 3.5 mm (0.14 in). Individuals weight 27–31 g (0.95–1.09 oz). It has a dental formula of 1.1.1.31.1.2.3 for a total of 26 teeth.",
    "Range and habitat": "The black mastiff bat is a widespread species, occurring throughout much of Central and South America. Its range includes the following countries: Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, and Uruguay. Its habitat includes forests and shrublands, with human structures used as roosts.",
    "Conservation": "As of 2015, it is evaluated as a least-concern species by the IUCN.

The species is known to be impacted by the parasite Hesperoctenes fumarius.\n\n\n== References =="
