    "__SUMMARY__": "Isabelle's ghost bat (Diclidurus isabella) is a bat species found in northwestern Brazil, Guyana, and Venezuela, and possibly Colombia. It was discovered in October 1916 by Emilie Snethlage, and described by Oldfield Thomas in 1920.\nWhile the species name is suggestive that he named it after someone, his notes did not say this as they usually did when he named a species after someone. It has been suggested that the species name is in reference to the color isabelline, which describes the color of this species. In that case, the common name should instead be the isabelline ghost bat.\nThey are pale brown in color, with the head and shoulders appearing whitish. Their forearms are approximately 54 mm (2.1 in) long.",
