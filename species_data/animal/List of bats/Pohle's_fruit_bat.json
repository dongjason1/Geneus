    "__SUMMARY__": "Pohle's fruit bat (Casinycteris ophiodon) is a near threatened species of megabat found in the subtropical or tropical forests of Cameroon, the Republic of Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana and Liberia.",
    "Taxonomy": "In 2014, its taxonomy was revised. While it was previously in the genus Scotonycteris, analysis of mitochondrial DNA showed that it should be placed in Casinycteris to avoid paraphyly of Scotonycteris.",
    "Description": "These bats are also known as 'tear-drop' fruit bats because of the prominent tear-like white spots found on both sides of their eyes and on their upper lips. Their fur is tinted and the wings are dark brown. They measure 74-78 millimeters and weigh between 35 and 60 grams.",
    "Ecology": "These bats live in the lowland forests of West and Central Africa, mostly in the lowest level of undergrowth, where they feed on various fruits and flowers.",
    "Conservation": "The main threats to this species' habitat include agriculture, mining, logging, and human disturbances such as fire. There are established policy based legislation actions as well as habitat and site-based action in protected areas.\n\n\n== References =="
