    "Taxonomy": "It was described as a subspecies of the arcuate horseshoe bat (R. arcuatus) in 1982 by J. E. Hill and D. A. Schlitter.\nThe holotype had been collected in 1980 in Telefomin, Papua New Guinea.\nThey gave it the trinomen of R. arcuatus mcintyrei.\nThe eponym for the subspecies name \"mcintyrei\" is Thomas McIntyre, thus honored for his support and appreciation of Australasian mammal research.\nIn 2013, Patrick et al. published that R. a. mcintyrei should be considered a full species.",
