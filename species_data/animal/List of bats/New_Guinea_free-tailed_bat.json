    "__SUMMARY__": "The New Guinea free-tailed bat (Austronomus kuboriensis), sometimes designated the New Guinea mastiff bat, is an extant species of free-tailed bat that inhabits the Chimbu highlands of Papua New Guinea. Although Koopman describes A. kuboriensis as a subspecies of the nearby A. australis (1982, 1994), the reference catalogue Mammal Species of the World suggests that recent analysis establishes these as distinct species.",
