    "__SUMMARY__": "The large-eared  slit-faced bat, Nycteris macrotis, is a species of slit-faced bat which lives in forests and savannas throughout Africa. Nycteris vinsoni was once considered a synonym of N. macrotis, but it became recognized as a separate species in 2004. Some, however, still consider N. vinsoni to be a subspecies of N. macrotis, and consider N. macrotis a species complex.\nThree subspecies have been noted: N. m. aethiopica, N. m. luteola, and N. m. macrotis.\n\n\n== References =="
