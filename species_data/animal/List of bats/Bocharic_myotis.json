    "__SUMMARY__": "The Bocharic myotis or Bokhara whiskered bat (Myotis bucharensis) is a species of mouse-eared bat in the family Vespertilionidae, described in 1950, and indigenous to Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Since investigators failed to locate the species during field trips in the 1970s and 1980s, the International Union for Conservation of Nature suggests that M. bucharensis is potentially extinct in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Aside from living in caves in arid areas, nothing else is known about the species.",
