    "__SUMMARY__": "The Halmahera blossom bat (Syconycteris carolinae) is a species of megabat in the family Pteropodidae.\nThe bat is endemic to Halmahera and Bacan islands, of the northern Maluku Islands archipelago in Indonesia.\nIt is an IUCN Red List Vulnerable species because: its extent of occurrence is less than 20,000 km²; it is known only from three locations; and there is ongoing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat due to intensified habitat destruction. A 2017 study ranked the species as the 8th highest research priority among island endemic bats based on conservation situation and current data availability.\n\n\n== References =="
