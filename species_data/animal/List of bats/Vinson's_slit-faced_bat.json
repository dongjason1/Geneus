    "__SUMMARY__": "Vinson's  slit-faced bat (Nycteris vinsoni) is a species of slit-faced bat known only from two specimens. Both specimens were smoked out of a baobab tree in a national park in southern Mozambique. Virtually nothing is known about this species.\nN. vinsoni was once considered a synonym of Nycteris macrotis, but it became recognized as a separate species in 2004. Some, however, still consider N. vinsoni to be a subspecies of N. macrotis. Others believe the correct name for the species should be N. aetheopica.\n\n\n== References =="
