    "__SUMMARY__": "Bate's slit-faced bat (Nycteris arge) is a species of slit-faced bat frequently confused with Nycteris major. It is broadly distributed and common, living throughout many parts of Africa in forests and savannas.",
    "Taxonomy": "It was described as a new species in 1903 by British zoologist Oldfield Thomas.\nThe holotype had been collected from Cameroon by George Latimer Bates.",
    "Description": "Bates's slit-faced bat, as the common name suggests, has a \"deep median furrow\" down its face.\nIts ears are large and rounded.\nIts dental formula is 2.1.1.33.1.2.3 for a total of 32 teeth.\nIt has a particularly large brain for an insectivorous bat species.",
    "Range and habitat": "It is found throughout Central and West Africa, including Angola, Benin, Burundi, Cameroon, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, and Uganda.\nIt is found in lowland areas.",
    "Conservation": "As of 2017, it is evaluated as a least-concern species by the IUCN.\nIt meets the criteria for this classification because it has a large geographic range; its population is presumably large; and it is not likely experiencing rapid population decline.\n\n\n== References =="
