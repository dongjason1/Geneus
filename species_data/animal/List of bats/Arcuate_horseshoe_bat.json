    "__SUMMARY__": "The arcuate horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus arcuatus) is a species of bat in the family Rhinolophidae. It is found in Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines.",
    "Taxonomy and etymology": "It was described as a new species in 1871 by German zoologist Wilhelm Peters.\n\nIts species name \"arcuatus\" is Latin for \"curved,\" though Peters gave no explanation as to why he named it thus.\nStrahan and Conder hypothesized that it was a reference to the appearance of its nose-leaf.",
    "Biology and ecology": "It is nocturnal, roosting in sheltered places during the day such as limestone caves.\nAt night it forages for its insect prey by gleaning them off substrates and aerial hawking.",
    "Range and habitat": "Its range includes several countries in Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia.\nIt is also found in Papua New Guinea in Oceania.\nIt has been documented at elevations from sea level to 1,600 m (5,200 ft) above sea level.",
    "Conservation": "As of 2008, it is evaluated as a least-concern species by the IUCN.\nIt meets the criteria for this classification because it has a wide geographic range; its population is presumably large; and it is also tolerant of a variety of habitat types.\nFurthermore, it is unlikely that it is experiencing rapid population decline.\n\n\n== References =="
