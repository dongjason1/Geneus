    "__SUMMARY__": "The Anjouan myotis (Myotis anjouanensis) is a species of vesper bat. It is found only in Comoros.",
    "Taxonomy and etymology": "It was described as a new species in 1960 by French zoologist Jean Dorst.\nDorst described the species based on specimens that had been collected by Léon Humblot in 1886.\nIt has variably been considered a subspecies of the Malagasy mouse-eared bat.\nHowever, in 1995 and 2005, it was published as a full species.\nThe species name \"anjouanensis\" means \"belonging to Anjouan\"—the island where the holotype was collected.",
    "Range and habitat": "It is found only on Anjouan island of the Comoros.\nThe individual observed in 2006 was captured flying through a tunnel surrounded by \"heavily disturbed forest\" and agricultural plots.",
    "Conservation": "As of 2008, it is evaluated as a data deficient species by the IUCN.\nIt is a rarely-observed species.\nA single individual was captured in 2006, representing perhaps the first documentation of this species in over 120 years.\n\n\n== References =="
