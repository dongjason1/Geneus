Few specimens have been obtained, and the IUCN notes that lack of study on ecology, threats, population and distribution. It is presumed to be vulnerable to habitat clearing. The roost sites are trees and caves, inhabited individually or as small groups. It is presumed to glean insects in montane forest.\n\n\n== References =="
