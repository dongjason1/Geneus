    "__SUMMARY__": "The Formosan golden tube-nosed bat (Harpiola isodon) is native to the high-altitude regions of Taiwan.",
    "Taxonomy and etymology": "It was described as a new species in 2006.\nThe holotype had been collected in Yuli Wildlife Refuge in Zhuoxi, Taiwan in 1998.\nIts species name \"isodon\" means \"equal-toothed.\"\nThe researchers who described the species chose this name because of the almost-equal basal area of the canines, first premolars, and second premolars.",
    "Description": "It is a medium-sized tube-nosed bat, with an average forearm length of 31–36 mm (1.2–1.4 in).\nIts guard hairs have shiny, golden tips, inspiring its common name.\nIts dorsal fur is very long, while the ventral fur is shorter.\nIts fur texture is woolly.\nIndividual hairs are dark brown at their bases, bright yellow in the middle, and dark brown again at their tips.\nIts uropatagium is densely furred both above and below.\nIts ears are 12.5–13 mm (0.49–0.51 in) long; its tragi are 6.5–8 mm (0.26–0.31 in) long.",
    "Range and habitat": "It has been documented in the mountainous regions of Taiwan, from elevations of 1,000–2,400 m (3,300–7,900 ft) above sea level.\nIn 2006, it was published that the species had been documented in Vietnam for the first time.",
    "Conservation": "It is currently assessed as data deficient by the IUCN.\nIts only IUCN assessment was published in 2008, only two years after the species was described.\nThe IUCN stated that there was not enough information on the extent and ecology of the species to make an accurate conservation assessment.\n\n\n== References =="
