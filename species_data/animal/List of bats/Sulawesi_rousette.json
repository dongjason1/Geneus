    "__SUMMARY__": "The Sulawesi rousette (Rousettus celebensis) is a species of megabat in the family Pteropodidae endemic to Sulawesi, an island in Indonesia.",
    "Diet": "Rousettus celebensis is a fruit-eating bat; it has big wings which allow it to carry heavy loads and also make it a good seed disperser. Its diet consists of large seeds, an uncommon feature, compared to other frugivorous bats. R. celebensis has a unique digestive system which allows it to digest certain seeds or seed coats or both.",
    "Anatomy": "The tibia of R. celebensis is covered in dense fur. Its antitragal lobe is fairly reduced. The bony arch of its cheek is narrow and triangular in shape. The male's distal end of the penis has a flattened and triangular shape.\n\n\n== References =="
