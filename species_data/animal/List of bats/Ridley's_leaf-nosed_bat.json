    "__SUMMARY__": "Ridley's leaf-nosed bat, Ridley's roundleaf bat, or Singapore roundleaf horseshoe bat (Hipposideros ridleyi) is a species of bat in the family Hipposideridae. It is found in Brunei, Malaysia and Singapore. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical swamps. It is threatened by habitat loss.",
    "Taxonomy": "Ridley's leaf-nosed bat was described as a new species in 1911 by Herbert Christopher Robinson and C. Boden Kloss. The holotype had been collected by English botanist Henry Nicholas Ridley in the Singapore Botanic Gardens in 1911.",
    "Description": "Ridley's leaf-nosed bat has a forearm length of 47–51 mm (1.9–2.0 in). Its nose-leaf is very large and dark, covering its muzzle. The nose-leaf lacks lateral leaflets (smaller projections to the side).",
    "Range and habitat": "It is found in Southeast Asia where it has been documented in Brunei, Malaysia, and Singapore. It is found at a range of elevations from 0–500 m (0–1,640 ft) above sea level. Its habitat is lowland old-growth forest. Possibly, its range also includes Indonesia.",
    "Conservation": "As of 2008, it is evaluated as a vulnerable species by the IUCN. It met the criteria for this classification because predicted habitat loss from 2008–2018 meant that the species would likely experience a population reduction of more than 30%.",
