    "__SUMMARY__": "The Taiwan broad-muzzled myotis (Submyotodon latirostris) is a species of vesper bat found in Taiwan.",
    "Taxonomy": "It was described as a new species in 1932 by Japanese arachnologist Kyukichi Kishida.\nThe holotype had been collected in Taiwan.\nKishida placed it in the genus Myotis with a binomial of M. latirostris.\nIn subsequent publications, it was considered by various authors to be a subspecies of the whiskered bat (M. mystacinus) or the wall-roosting mouse-eared bat (M. muricola).\nHowever, its lineage is basal to all other Myotis species.\nIt is still within the Myotinae subfamily, though its morphological and genetic differences justified placing it in a separate genus.",
    "Description": "It is a small species of bat, with a forearm length of 31–34 mm (1.2–1.3 in).\nIts skull is overall smooth and lacking crests, and the occipital bone of the braincase is distinctly raised, which is one if its identifying features.\nThe fur of its back is long and shaggy, described as a \"dark slaty brown.\"\nThe tips of individual hairs are lighter brown.\nThe fur of its belly is also dark brown, though the tips of the hairs are a more golden color.",
    "Range and habitat": "It is found in Taiwan, where it is considered relatively common.\nIt is generally encountered in mountainous areas with elevations greater than 1,000 m (3,300 ft) above sea level, though it is found in lower elevations in the winter.\nIts maximum elevation range is at least 2,200 m (7,200 ft) above sea level.\n\n\n== References =="
