    "__SUMMARY__": "The Beijing mouse-eared bat, or Peking myotis (Myotis pequinius) is a species of vesper bat. It is found only in China.",
    "Taxonomy": "It was described as a new species in 1908 by British zoologist Oldfield Thomas.\nThe holotype had been collected by Malcolm Playfair Anderson in 1907.\nAnderson encountered the species in a cave 30 mi (48 km) west of Beijing.",
    "Description": "It is a relatively large mouse-eared bat with a forearm length of 48–50 mm (1.9–2.0 in).\nIts fur is short and velvety, with the fur on its back a gray, reddish-brown.\nIn contrast, its belly fur is off-white.",
    "Biology and ecology": "It is insectivorous, consuming mostly beetles.\nDuring the day, individuals roost in caves, though they may also roost in human structures.",
    "Range and habitat": "The Beijing mouse-eared bat is endemic to China, where it is found in the provinces of Anhui, Beijing, Henan, Jiangsu, Shanxi, and Sichuan.",
    "Conservation": "As of 2008, it is evaluated as a least-concern species by the IUCN.\nIt meets the criteria for this classification because its extent of occurrence exceeds 20,000 km2 (7,700 sq mi); its population is presumably large; and it is unlikely to be experiencing rapid population decline.",
