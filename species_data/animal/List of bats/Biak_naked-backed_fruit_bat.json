    "__SUMMARY__": "The Biak naked-backed fruit bat (Dobsonia emersa) is a species of megabat in the family Pteropodidae. It is endemic to Indonesia.",
    "Taxonomy and etymology": "The Biak naked-backed fruit bat was first described as a species in 1985.\nIts species name \"emersa\" is from Latin \"emergere,\" meaning \"to emerge.\"\nBergmans and Sarbini selected this name because zoologists such as Fredericus Anna Jentink had written about Dobsonia species from this area long ago, but had overlooked this taxa.",
    "Description": "It has a curved snout and relatively large eyes.\nIts teeth are small and narrow.\nAdults have a forearm length of approximately 114 mm (4.5 in) and weigh 169–180 g (6.0–6.3 oz).",
    "Range and habitat": "It is endemic to Indonesia.\nIt is a lowland species, found at 0–30 m (0–98 ft) above sea level.\nIt occupies both primary and secondary forests.",
    "Conservation": "As of 2008, it is evaluated as a vulnerable species by the IUCN.\nIt meets the criteria for this classification because it is known from fewer than five locations.\nIt is susceptible to population decline via overhunting and disturbance of its roost sites.\n\n\n== References =="
