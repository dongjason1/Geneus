    "__SUMMARY__": "Benkeith's short-tailed bat (Carollia benkeithi) is a leaf-nosed bat species found in Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil.\nIt very closely resembles the chestnut short-tailed bat, and the two species are likely often confused.",
    "Taxonomy and etymology": "Benkeith's short-tailed bat was described as a new species in 2006.\nThe holotype had been collected in 1983, 2 km (1.2 mi) to the south of Tingo María, Peru.\nThe eponym for the species name \"benkeithi\" was Ben E. Keith, who donated $5 million to Texas Tech University.",
    "Description": "Benkeith's short-tailed bat is a relatively small species of short-tailed fruit bat.\nIt has a forearm length of 33.7–37.2 mm (1.33–1.46 in) and a head and body length of 52–68 mm (2.0–2.7 in).\nThe fur on its back is chestnut brown, while its belly fur is a dull, grayish-brown.",
    "Biology and ecology": "Based on stable isotope analysis, it likely consumes a considerable amount of insects in addition to plant material such as fruit.",
    "Range and habitat": "Benkeith's short-tailed bat is found in northeastern Bolivia, eastern Peru, and western Brazil.\nIn Brazil, it is uncommon within the central Amazon basin.",
