    "__SUMMARY__": "Beccari's sheath-tailed bat (Emballonura beccarii) is a species of sac-winged bat in the family Emballonuridae. It is found in New Guinea and in some nearby islands in both Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.",
    "Taxonomy and etymology": "It was described as a new species in 1881 by German naturalist Wilhelm Peters and Italian naturalist Giacomo Doria. The eponym for the species name \"beccari\" is Dr. Odoardo Beccari, an Italian botanist who conducted a zoological research expedition on the island of New Guinea where the bat was first documented.",
    "Biology": "It is nocturnal, roosting in sheltered places such as caves during the day. At night, it forages for its prey—insects—along forest streams, in dense forests, and in clearings.",
    "Range and habitat": "Its range includes several islands of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. It has been documented from 0–1,500 m (0–4,921 ft) above sea level.",
    "Conservation": "It is currently evaluated as least concern by the IUCN. It meets the criteria for this assessment because it has a large range, its population is thought to be large, and because its population is not likely to be in rapid decline. Some populations may be threatened by overharvesting for bushmeat.\n\n\n== References =="
