    "__SUMMARY__": "The Solomons flying fox (Pteropus rayneri) is a species of flying fox in the family Pteropodidae. It is endemic to the Solomon Islands archipelago.  The population abundance has been marked by periodic die-offs of generally unknown cause, including a major die-off in the 1980s.  Hunting may be a significant threat to the population.\n\n\n== References =="
