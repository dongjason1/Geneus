The ears tilt forward, and the face has a triangular shape and pale skin.  Both sexes of this species are similar in size unlike other species.\nThey have brown fur with it getting darker as it reaches the tip.They tend to live in deep and very humid caves and have groups from 100 up to 10,000 bats.They are found from Mexico through Central America to Eastern Brazil, the Yucatan Peninsula, Honduras, Panama, the Lesser Antilles, Hispaniola, and Jamaica.The related species Natalus espiritosantensis (formerly known as Natalus stramineus ssp. espiritosantensis) is endemic to Brazil, and the sub-species Lesser Antillean funnel-eared bat (Natalus stramineus stramineus) is endemic to the Lesser Antilles islands.",
