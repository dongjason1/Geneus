    "__SUMMARY__": "The Sumba roundleaf bat (Hipposideros sumbae) is a species of bat in the family Hipposideridae. It lives in Indonesia and East Timor. It is present on the islands of Sumba, Rote, Sumbawa, Flores, Semau, and Savu.",
    "Taxonomy and etymology": "It was initially described as a subspecies of the intermediate roundleaf bat (Hipposideros larvatus) in 1960 by Oei Hong Peng.\nIts species name \"sumbae\" is derived from Sumba Island where the holotype was found.\nAs the genus Hipposideros is speciose, it is divided into closely related species groups— the Sumba roundleaf bat is in the larvatus species group.",
    "Biology": "It is nocturnal, roosting in sheltered places such as caves and houses during the day.\nIt likely roosts in large colonies.\nIt is insectivorous.",
    "Conservation": "It is currently evaluated as least concern by the IUCN.\nIt meets the criteria for this classification because its extent of occurrence is greater than 200,000 km2 (77,000 sq mi); it is locally common; and it tolerates human modification of the landscape, as evinced by it roosting in houses sometimes.\nIt may be declining due to the mining of limestone from its caves.\n\n\n== References =="
