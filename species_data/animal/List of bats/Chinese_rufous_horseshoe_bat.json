    "__SUMMARY__": "The Chinese rufous horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) is a species of bat in the family Rhinolophidae. It is found in China, India, Nepal, and Vietnam.The species is most easily confused with R. affinis, from which it is best distinguished by its straight-sided lancet and the relatively short second phalanx of the third digit (< 66% of the length of the metacarpal: Csorba et al., 2003).\nChinese rufous horseshoe bats are a least-concern species, assessed by the Red List of Threatened Species on the basis that it has fairly wide distribution and is locally common in southeast Asia. The species is not listed in the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Wildlife in 1989.\n\n\n== References =="
