    "Conservation": "As of 2008, it is evaluated as a least-concern species by the IUCN.\nIt meets the criteria for this classification because it has a wide geographic range; its population size is presumably large; its numbers are not declining; and it tolerates some human disturbance to the environment.\nNo major threats to this species have been identified.\n\n\n== References =="
