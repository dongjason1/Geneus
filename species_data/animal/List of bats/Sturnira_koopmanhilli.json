    "__SUMMARY__": "Sturnira koopmanhilli is a species of leaf-nosed bat found in South America.",
    "Taxonomy": "It was described as a new species in 2006. The holotype had been collected in 1991 in Cotacachi Cayapas Ecological Reserve—a nature reserve in Ecuador.\nThe eponyms for its species name \"koopmanhilli\" are American zoologist Karl Koopman (1920 – 1997) and British mammalogist John Edwards Hill (1928 – 1997).",
    "Description": "Males have a forearm length of 49.2–52.4 mm (1.94–2.06 in), while females have a forearm length of 48.1–52.2 mm (1.89–2.06 in). Additionally, males weigh 30.0 g (1.06 oz), while females weigh 25.5–31.5 g (0.90–1.11 oz).\nIt has a dental formula of 2.1.2.32.1.2.3 for a total of 32 teeth.",
    "Range and habitat": "S. koopmanhilli has been documented in Ecuador and Colombia.\nIt has been documented at a range of altitudes, from 300–2,000 m (980–6,560 ft) above sea level.",
    "Conservation": "As of 2016, it is evaluated as a data deficient species by the IUCN.\nIt meets the criteria for this designation because basic details of its biology and ecology are yet unknown. The extent of its geographic range is also poorly understood, as are any threats that it may be facing.\nIt is possibly impacted by the deforestation of the Tumbes-Chocó-Magdalena region, though.\n\n\n== References =="
