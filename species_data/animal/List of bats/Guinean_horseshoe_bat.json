    "__SUMMARY__": "The Guinean horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus guineensis) is a species of bat in the family Rhinolophidae. It is found in Ivory Coast, Guinea, Liberia, Senegal, and Sierra Leone. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forest, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest, subtropical or tropical moist montane forest, moist savanna, caves, and subterranean habitats (other than caves). It is threatened by habitat loss.",
    "Taxonomy and etymology": "It was described by M. Eisentraut in 1960 as a new subspecies of the Lander's horseshoe bat with a trinomen of Rhinolophus landeri guineensis.\nThe holotype was collected near Kolenté, Guinea.\nIn 1978, it was elevated to full species status.",
    "Description": "It is considered \"medium-sized\" for an African horseshoe bat.\nIts forearm length is 44–50 mm (1.7–2.0 in) and individuals weigh 8–11 g (0.28–0.39 oz).\nIts dental formula is 1.1.2.32.1.3.3 for a total of 32 teeth.",
    "Range and habitat": "Its range includes several countries in West Africa such as Ivory Coast, Guinea, Liberia, Senegal, and Sierra Leone.\nIt is found in high elevations greater than 1,400 m (4,600 ft) above sea level.",
    "Conservation": "As of 2008, it is listed as a vulnerable species by the IUCN.\nIt meets the criteria for this assessment because its area of occupancy is likely smaller than 2,000 km2 (770 sq mi); its habitat is highly fragmented; and there is ongoing and predicted degradation of its caves and forests.\n\n\n== References =="
