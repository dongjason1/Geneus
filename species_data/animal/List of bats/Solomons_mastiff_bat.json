    "__SUMMARY__": "The Solomons mastiff bat (Chaerephon solomonis) is a species of bat in the family Molossidae. It is endemic to the Solomon Islands.",
    "Taxonomy and etymology": "It was described as a new species by Australian mammalogist Ellis Le Geyt Troughton in 1931.\nTroughton likely chose the species name \"solomonis\" because this species was first discovered on the Solomon Islands.\nIt is sometimes classified as a subspecies of the northern freetail bat, Chaerephon jobensis.\nThe genus Chaerephon was formerly considered a subgenus of or synonymous with the genus Tadarida, meaning that this species has been known as Tadarida jobensis solomonis or Tadarida solomonis.",
    "Description": "Its forearm is 40.5–45 mm (1.59–1.77 in).\nIn total, its head and body are 63–68 mm (2.5–2.7 in) long, while its tail is 35–36 mm (1.4–1.4 in) long.\nIts fur is a rich, auburn brown, with white hairs interspersed infrequently.\nIts tragus is lobed and broad at the tip.",
    "Range and habitat": "Its range is currently known to include Choiseul Island and Santa Isabel Island, both of which are part of the Solomon Islands.",
    "Conservation": "It is evaluated as least concern by the IUCN.\nIt meets the criteria for this designation because it is a common species, and future studies will likely expand its range to other islands. \nIts population is assumed to be large, and it is not thought to be in rapid decline, which would qualify it for a more urgent classification.\n\n\n== References =="
