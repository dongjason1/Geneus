    "__SUMMARY__": "The Angolan long-eared bat (Laephotis angolensis) is a species of vesper bat in the Vespertilionidae family. It can be found in moist savanna in Angola and Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
    "Taxonomy and etymology": "It was described as a new species in 1935 by Albert Monard.\nIn papers published in 1953 and 1971, the Angolan long-eared bat was treated as a subspecies of De Winton's long-eared bat.\nHowever, it is generally treated as a full species at present.\nIt has been suggested that it may be synonymous with Botswanan long-eared bat.\nIts species name \"angolensis\" is Latin for \"Angolan,\" likely in reference to the fact that the holotype was encountered near Dala, Angola.",
    "Description": "Its dental formula is 2.1.1.33.1.2.3 for a total of 32 teeth.\nThe fur of its back is yellowish- or reddish-brown.\nVentral fur is pale gray or cream in color.",
    "Range and habitat": "It has only been documented in the Central Zambezian miombo woodlands.\nIts range includes Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
    "Conservation": "It is considered a locally rare species.\nAs of 2008, it is assessed as a data deficient species by the IUCN.\nThe organization is unable to accurately evaluate its conservation status because of the continued uncertainty on whether or not it represents a full species.\nIn addition, there is a lack of up-to-date research on its extent and population trends.\n\n\n== References =="
