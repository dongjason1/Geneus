    "__SUMMARY__": "The bidentate yellow-shouldered bat (Sturnira bidens) is a species of bat in the family Phyllostomidae. It is found in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela.",
    "Taxonomy and etymology": "It was described as a new species in 1915 by British zoologist Oldfield Thomas.\nThe holotype had been collected by Walter Goodfellow in April 1914 in Baeza, Ecuador.\nThomas described a new, now-defunct genus, Corvira, giving the species the binomial of Corvira bidens.\nThe species name \"bidens\" is Latin for \"two teeth;\" of the bidentate yellow bat, Thomas wrote, \"lower incisors only two.\"",
    "Description": "It has a forearm length of 39.3–43.3 mm (1.55–1.70 in).\nIt has a long and narrow snout and an overall narrow skull.\nIt has a dental formula of 2.1.2.31.1.2.3 for a total of 30 teeth.",
    "Range and habitat": "Its range includes Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela.\nIt is found in association with the Andes Mountains at elevations of 1,700–3,000 m (5,600–9,800 ft).",
    "Conservation": "As of 2018, it is evaluated as a least-concern species by the IUCN, which is its lowest conservation priority.\nIt has a wide geographic range; its population is presumably large; and it is unlikely to be experiencing rapid population decline.\nIts population is not severely fragmented, and its population trend is projected as stable.\n\n\n== References =="
