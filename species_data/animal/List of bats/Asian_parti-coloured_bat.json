    "Description": "Its forearm length is 43–55 mm (1.7–2.2 in).\nIts hairs are bicolored, with the basal portions blackish brown and the distal portions off-white.",
    "Range and habitat": "Its range includes several countries and regions in eastern Asia, such as China and Taiwan, Japan, North and South Korea, Mongolia, and Siberia.",
    "Conservation": "As of 2008, it is evaluated as a least-concern species by the IUCN.\nIt meets the criteria for this classification because it has a wide geographic range; it tolerates a variety of habitats, including human-disturbed areas; and there are no known threats to its continued existence.\n\n\n== References =="
