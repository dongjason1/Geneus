    "__SUMMARY__": "The gnome fruit-eating bat (Dermanura gnoma) is a bat species from South America. It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela. This species was originally discovered to be different from the other known species of fruit bats, but later, in 1994 were mistakenly grouped under Artibeus cinereus as a synonym. However, this has since been corrected by more closely studying their physical differences and by biomolecular analysis.\n\n\n== References =="
