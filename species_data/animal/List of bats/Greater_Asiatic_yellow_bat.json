    "__SUMMARY__": "The greater Asiatic yellow bat (Scotophilus heathii) is a species of vesper bat.It is found in Afghanistan,  Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam.Like many bats, females have delayed ovulation, with the ability to store sperm. This makes them particularly of interest to biologists. Studies have shown that seasonal changes in hormones allow them to deposit fat before the onset of winter.It is named after Josiah Marshall Heath, who presented the type specimen to the Zoological Society of London.",
