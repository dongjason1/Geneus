    "__SUMMARY__": "The great roundleaf bat (Hipposideros armiger) is a species of bat in the family Hipposideridae found in China, India, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam.",
    "Description": "The great roundleaf bat is similar in appearance to the closely related intermediate roundleaf bat (H. larvatus). However, the great roundleaf bat is larger and possesses four, not three, lateral accessory leaflets on each side of the main noseleaf. This bat has a forearm length up to 9.8 cm , and weighs up to 60 g. After an experiment published by Kathryn Knight , in which they painted the accessory leaflets and the ears and videotaped, it was concluded that when they clicked the leaflets closed and their ears bent down. When listening to the clicking they opened their noseleaf and their ears. \n\n\n== References =="
