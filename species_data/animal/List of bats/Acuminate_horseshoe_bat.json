    "Taxonomy and etymology": "It was described as a new species in 1871 by German naturalist Wilhelm Peters. Its species name \"acuminatus\" is Latin for \"pointed.\" The inspiration for this name was perhaps its \"sharply upwards pointed sella.\"",
    "Description": "Its forearm length is 48–50 mm (1.9–2.0 in); its tail length is 21–31 mm (0.83–1.22 in); its ear length is 20–21 mm (0.79–0.83 in). It weighs 11.5–13.5 g (0.41–0.48 oz).",
    "Biology and ecology": "It is nocturnal, roosting in sheltered places during the day such as inside caves or on the undersides of palm leaves. It roosts in small colonies.",
    "Range and habitat": "It is found in several countries in Southeast Asia, including Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam.",
    "Conservation": "It is currently evaluated as least concern by the IUCN—its lowest conservation priority. It meets the criteria for this assessment because it is a widespread species considered locally common. Its range includes protected areas. It lacks major threats, although cave disturbance by humans is a local threat.\n\n\n== References =="
