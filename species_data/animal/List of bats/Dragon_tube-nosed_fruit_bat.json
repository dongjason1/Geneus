    "__SUMMARY__": "The dragon tube-nosed fruit bat (Nyctimene draconilla) is a species of bat in the family Pteropodidae. It is found on both sides of New Guinea: West Papua, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. It is slightly smaller and very similar in appearance to N. albiventer, differing by having more profuse, dark spotting on its wing membranes, and smaller shorter canines.  The similarity between the species has been a source of possible misidentifications.  The records of this species from Papua New Guinea are associated with freshwater swamps and rivers.\n\n\n== Sources =="
