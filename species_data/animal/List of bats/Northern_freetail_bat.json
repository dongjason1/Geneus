    "__SUMMARY__": "The northern freetail bat (Chaerephon jobensis) is a species of bat found in Yapen, Seram Island, Western New Guinea and Northern Australia.",
    "Taxonomy and etymology": "It was described as a new species in 1902 by American zoologist Gerrit Smith Miller.\nMiller placed it in the now-defunct genus Nyctinomus, naming it Nyctinomus jobensis.\nMiller likely chose the species name \"jobensis\" because the holotype was discovered on Jobie Island near the community of Ansus.\nThe holotype was collected by Italian naturalist Odoardo Beccari.",
    "Description": "It has been described as having \"features reminiscent of Darth Vader.\"\nFrom head to tail, it is approximately 98 mm (3.9 in) long.\nIts head and body is 80–90 mm (3.1–3.5 in) long, and its tail is 35–45 mm (1.4–1.8 in) long.\nIts forearm is 46–52 mm (1.8–2.0 in) long.\nIt weighs 20–30 g (0.71–1.06 oz).",
    "Biology and behavior": "They will fly and forage in groups of two or more individuals.\nIts foraging style utilizes fast, direct flight suited for open areas or above canopies.\nIt is insectivorous, consuming beetles, bugs, moths, lacewings, grasshoppers, cockroaches, flies and leafhoppers.\nIt is one of the only species of bat in Australia that can be heard when foraging.\nIts echolocation frequency is relatively low (15-25kHz), overlapping with the upper range of sounds audible to humans.\nIt is nocturnal, roosting in sheltered places during the day such as tree hollows or caves.\nThese roosts can consist of many individuals, as it is a colonial species.",
    "Range and habitat": "It prefers to forage in the tropical savannas of Northern Australia.\nIt is also found in urban areas, using artificial lights to forage for the insects attracted to them.",
    "Conservation": "It is currently evaluated as least concern by the IUCN—its lowest conservation priority.\nIt meets the criteria for this assessment because it has a large geographic range, a large population, it occurs in protected areas, and it tolerates human modification of landscapes.\nIts population trend is stable.\n\n\n== References =="
