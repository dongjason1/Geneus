    "__SUMMARY__": "The fraternal myotis (Myotis frater) is a species of vesper bat.  An adult fraternal myotis has a body length of about 5 cm, a tail of about 4.5 cm, and a wing span of about 3.8 cm.",
    "Distribution": "The species is found sporadically through Central and East Asia, including China (Fujian, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Anhui, inner Mongolia, and Heilongjiang), Russia (southern Siberia), Korea, and Japan (Honshu and Hokkaido).",
    "Data deficiency": "The IUCN Red List explains:  \"This species is widespread but has a fragmented distribution. There is relatively little information available on population trends and threats. In Japan this species is listed as Vulnerable and in Russia it is listed as a rare species. The Chinese population could be a distinct species, but more research is required to clarify this. Listed as Data Deficient because of taxonomic uncertainty and lack of data.\"",
