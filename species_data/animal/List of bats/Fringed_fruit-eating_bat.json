    "__SUMMARY__": "The fringed fruit-eating bat (Artibeus fimbriatus), is a bat species from South America. It is found in Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay.The species are mainly inhabited in the Neotropical climates. They thrive in little rainfall and in days that are abundant in sun light. Fimbriatus, are dependent on abiotic factors in the wild. For scavenging, they mainly feed on fruits, seeds, but mainly all of the food that eat are ficus and leafy bushes.Their reproduction process is dependent on the time of day and the climate. The process begins in warmer climates and longer day light timings.There is no known existing problem of extinction for the bats, but the restoration of forests and forest community heavily impact on the diversity and can steadily decline the diverse bat population    \n\n\n== References =="
