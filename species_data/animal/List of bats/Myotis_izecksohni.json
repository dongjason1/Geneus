    "__SUMMARY__": "Myotis izecksohni is a species of mouse-eared bat that is endemic to Brazil.",
    "Taxonomy": "M. izecksohni was described as a new species in 2011.\nThe holotype had been collected in 2005 in Tinguá Biological Reserve.\nThe eponym for the species name \"izecksohni\" is Brazilian biologist Eugênio Izecksohn.",
    "Description": "It is a medium- to large-bodied mouse-eared bat among those found in South America.\nIt has a forearm length ranging from 33.1–38.3 mm (1.30–1.51 in).\nIts fur is long with a silky texture; the fur of its back is bicolored, with the basal two-thirds of individual hairs dark, while the distal third is dark-brown to medium-brown.\nThe fur of its belly is also bicolored, though overall lighter brown than the back fur.\nIt lacks hairs along the outer edge of the uropatagium, which is a useful field identification characteristic.",
