    "__SUMMARY__": "The trident bat or trident leaf-nosed bat (Asellia tridens) is a species of bat in the family Hipposideridae. It is found in Afghanistan, Algeria, Burkina Faso, Chad, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Iran, Israel, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Oman, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Somalia, Sudan, Tunisia, Yemen, and possibly Tanzania. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests, dry savanna, subtropical or tropical dry shrubland, caves and hot deserts.\n\nThey can be identified by their distinct nose from which protrudes a nose-leaf with three cusps (a trident). Asellia tridens are light brown to red in color. Their average wingspan is 270.3 mm. The average length of the body is 6.6 to 9 cm. The average mean maximal weight for males is 14.76 g and the average mean maximal weight for females is 13.05 grams.",
