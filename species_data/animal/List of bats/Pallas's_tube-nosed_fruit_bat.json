    "__SUMMARY__": "The Pallas's tube-nosed bat, Torresian tube-nosed bat or northern tube-nosed bat, (Nyctimene cephalotes) is a species of megabat in the Nyctimene genus found in Indonesia.  Its range may extend to New Guinea, but sightings may be attributable to misidentification.  Its range may at one time also have extended to Timor, but was extirpated due to habitat loss.\n\n\n== References =="
