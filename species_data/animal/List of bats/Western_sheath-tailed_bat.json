    "__SUMMARY__": "The western sheath-tailed bat (Paremballonura tiavato) is a species of sac-winged bat (family Emballonuridae) found in Madagascar.",
    "Taxonomy": "The western sheath-tailed bat was described as a new species in 2006. The holotype had been collected in January 2001 in Ankarana Reserve. It was placed in the genus Emballonura with a scientific name of Emballonura tiavato.\nIn 2012, a new genus of bat was described, Paremballonura.\nBoth the western sheath-tailed bat and Peters's sheath-tailed bat were transferred to this new genus, making its scientific name Paremballonura tiavato.\nThe species name \"tiavato\" is Malagasy for \"likes rocks\". The authors chose this name due to the likelihood of documenting this species in an area with exposed rocky outcrops.",
    "Description": "It is a small species of bat, with a forearm length of 35–42 mm (1.4–1.7 in).\nThe fur on its back is long, somewhat silky in texture, and grayish brown, while the fur on its belly is paler.\nIt has a dental formula of 2.1.2.33.1.2.3.",
    "Range": "The western sheath-tailed bat is endemic to the island and country of Madagascar. So far, it has been documented on the western side of the island, which is karstic. Its elevation range is from 10–330 m (33–1,083 ft) above sea level.",
    "Conservation": "As of 2017, it is evaluated as a least-concern species by the IUCN. It meets the criteria for this classification because it is not likely to be in rapid population decline.\n\n\n== References =="
