    "Taxonomy and etymology": "It was described as a new species in 1841 by Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck.\nThe holotype was collected on Java.\nIts species name \"melanopogon\" comes from Ancient Greek \"mélās\" meaning \"black\" and \"pṓgōn\" meaning \"beard.\"",

    "Biology and ecology": "The black-bearded tomb bat is highly colonial, forming large aggregations of up to 15,000 individuals while roosting. These roosts are located in temples, ruins, or caves. It is a seasonal breeder; young are born after a gestation length of 120–125 days. The typical litter size is one individual, though twins have been documented.",
