    "__SUMMARY__": "The Brazilian funnel-eared bat (Natalus macrourus) is a South American bat species found in eastern Brazil. It roosts in caves, which makes it vulnerable to disturbance of these scarce sites, and in particular, to extermination campaigns against cave-roosting bats carried out in Brazil to combat rabies.It was formerly considered a subspecies of N. stramineus.\n\n\n== References =="
