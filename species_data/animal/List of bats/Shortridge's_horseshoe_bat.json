    "Description": "It is of medium size with a long mandible and a nose leaf which does not completely cover its nostril. It has brown fur with a relatively pale underside.",
    "Range and conservation status": "In China, the species is found in Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, Guangxi, Hubei, Hainan, Guangdong and Fujian provinces. It is also found in northern parts of India and in Burma. There is limited data on the habitat of R. shortridgei but specimens have been collected from a dipterocarp forest in Burma.
