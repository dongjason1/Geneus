    "__SUMMARY__": "Canut's horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus canuti) is a species of bat in the family Rhinolophidae. It is endemic to Indonesia.",
    "Taxonomy and etymology": "It was described as a new species in 1909 by Oldfield Thomas and Robert Charles Wroughton.\nThey chose the species name \"canuti\" to honor Danish mammalogist Knud Andersen.\n\"Canute\" is an anglicization of the Danish name \"Knud.\"\nThomas and Wroughton chose to honor Andersen when naming the species \"in recognition of the exhaustive work he has done on this complicated and difficult group.\"",
    "Description": "Its skull has a rostral projection; the projection is on the top of the skull, with its leading edge aligned over the fourth premolar.\nIts head and body is 65 mm (2.6 in) long.\nIts tail is 22 mm (0.87 in); its ears are 24 mm (0.94 in).\nIt has a very narrow connecting process between the sella and the posterior lancet.",
    "Biology": "It is insectivorous.\nIt is nocturnal, roosting in sheltered places during the day such as caves.\nThese roosts likely consist of many individuals, as it is presumed to be a colonial species.",
    "Range and habitat": "It is found on the Indonesian islands of Bali and Java.",
    "Conservation": "It is currently evaluated as vulnerable by the IUCN.\nIt meets the criteria for this assessment because its extent of occurrence is less than 20,000 km2 (7,700 sq mi); its ranges is fragmented; it depends on forests; and it is losing habitat.\nIt is thought that its population size is decreasing.\n\n\n== References =="
