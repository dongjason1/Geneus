    "__SUMMARY__": "The pied bat (Niumbaha superba), or badger bat, is a rare species of vesper bat in the family Vespertilionidae. It is the only species in the genus Niumbaha. While not related in any way, the pied bat partly resembles a bee, with light yellow stripes and blotches on its body, the stripes being primarily on its back, but these are more vector-like and symmetrical and have more angles on each stripe. An interesting thing to note is that the pied bat is a completely unique bat. Biology professor DeeAnn Reeder, one of the species' discoverers, said, \"Its cranial characters, its wing characters, its size, the ears – literally everything you look at doesn't fit. It's so unique that we need to create a new genus.\"",
    "Taxonomy": "First discovered in 1939 in Belgian Congo, the species was, at that time, placed in the genus Glauconycteris under the name Glauconycteris superba. Following a 2013 capture in South Sudan, only the fifth recorded capture of the species, the pied bat was determined to be of a new genus entirely, Niumbaha, named after the Zande word for \"rare\".",
    "Geographic range": "It is found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Ghana and South Sudan.",
    "Habitat": "Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests and subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests.",
    "Conservation status": "It is threatened by habitat loss.",
