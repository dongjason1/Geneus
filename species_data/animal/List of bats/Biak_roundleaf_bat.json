It is endemic to the Biak Islands (Schouten Islands) and Cenderawasih Bay (Geelvinck Bay) area of Papua Province, located in Western New Guinea, Indonesia.",
    "Taxonomy and etymology": "It was described as a new species in 1886 by British zoologist Oldfield Thomas and Italian naturalist Giacomo Doria.\nThey initially placed it in the now-defunct genus Phyllorhina, with the scientific name Phyllorhina papua.\nIts species name \"papua\" references Papua New Guinea where Odoardo Beccari collected the holotype.",
    "Description": "It has a forearm length of approximately 50.5 mm (1.99 in).\nIt has a nose-leaf with two lateral leaflets.",
    "Biology and ecology": "It is nocturnal, roosting in sheltered places during the day such as caves.",
    "Range and habitat": "It is endemic to Indonesia.\nIts range encompasses several islands of Indonesia, including Halmahera, Bacan, Gebe, Biak, Supiori, Numfoor, and Vogelkop Peninsula of New Guinea.",
    "Conservation": "As of 2008, it is evaluated as least concern by the IUCN—its lowest conservation priority.\nIt meets the criteria for this assessment because it is locally common within its range.\nIts habitat is unlikely to be rapidly declining in extent and quality, and its population trend is projected as stable.\n\n\n== References =="
