    "__SUMMARY__": "The Yucatan yellow bat (Rhogeessa aeneus) is a species of bat found in the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, and possibly also in Belize and Guatemala.  These small insectivorous bats forage on flying insects (most likely mosquitoes) at dawn and dusk.\nA small population of these bats has been observed on Spanish Lookout Caye, Belize, since at least 1998. They are on both the east and west sides of the mangrove caye, which is located east of Belize City in the Drowned Cayes Range.  According to the locals who work on the caye, the bats are thought to roost in the coconut trees during the day.\n\n\n== References =="
