    "__SUMMARY__": "The New Guinea long-eared bat, species Nyctophilus microtis, is a small flying mammal. It is found only in Papua New Guinea.",
    "Taxonomy": "The description of the species was published by Oldfield Thomas in 1888, recognising the affinity with Nyctophilus timoriensis, the name ascribed to Australian vespertilionid 'long-eared bat' taxa. Thomas's description of a new species in the genus Nyctophilus was the first to indicate the diversity of the group, previously described as monotypic.\nThe specimen is noted as collected at Sogere, South-east New Guinea by Henry Ogg Forbes, and deposited at BMNH, London.\n\n\n== References =="
