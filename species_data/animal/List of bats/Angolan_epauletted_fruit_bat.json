    "__SUMMARY__": "The Angolan epauletted fruit bat (Epomophorus angolensis) is a species of megabat in the family Pteropodidae. It is found in Angola and Namibia. Its natural habitats are dry savanna and moist savanna. It is threatened by habitat loss.",
    "Taxonomy and etymology": "It was described as a new species in 1870 by British zoologist John Edward Gray.\nGray described it as a \"variety\" of Epomophorus macrocephalus, which has since been synonymized with the Angolan epauletted fruit bat.\nIts species name \"angolensis\" is Latin for \"Angolan.\"",
    "Range and habitat": "It is found in two countries in Southern Africa, including Angola and Namibia.\nIt is generally found in low-lying areas, though its range may include some montane habitats as well.",
    "Conservation": "As of 2016, it is evaluated as a near-threatened species by the IUCN.\nIt meets the criteria for this assessment because it experienced an estimated population decline of 20-25% from 2004–2016.\nIt is also losing the riparian habitat and fruit trees that it depends on.\n\n\n== Sources =="
