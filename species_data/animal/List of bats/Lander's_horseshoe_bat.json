    "__SUMMARY__": "Lander's horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus landeri) is a species of bat in the family Rhinolophidae found in Africa. Its natural habitats are dry savanna, moist savanna, and caves.",
    "Taxonomy and etymology": "It was described as a new species in 1837 by English naturalist William Charles Linnaeus Martin.\nThe eponym for the species name \"landeri\" was explorer Richard Lander.\nMartin named the species after Lander because the holotype had been collected during Lander's expedition to Fernando Pó.\nIt was Martin's intention to posthumously honor Lander, calling him \"enterprising, but unfortunate\" after his untimely death at age 29.",
    "Description": "It is a medium-sized member of its family.\nIndividuals weigh 5–11 g (0.18–0.39 oz).\nTotal length is approximately 75 mm (3.0 in); tail length is 23 mm (0.91 in) and forearm length is 38–41 mm (1.5–1.6 in).",
    "Range and habitat": "It has been widely documented throughout Sub-Saharan Africa.\nIndividuals have been found at relatively high elevations—up to 2,000 m (6,600 ft) above sea level on Kenya's Mount Elgon.",
    "Conservation": "It is currently evaluated as least concern by the IUCN—its lowest conservation priority.\nIt meets the criteria for this assessment because it has a wide geographic range; its population size is likely large; and it unlikely that it is in rapid decline.\n\n\n== References =="
