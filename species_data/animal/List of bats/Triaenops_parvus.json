    "__SUMMARY__": "The Yemeni trident leaf-nosed bat (Triaenops parvus) is a species of bat found in the Middle East.",
    "Taxonomy and etymology": "It was described as a new species in 2009 by Benda and Vallo.\nBefore this, it had been considered synonymous with the rufous trident bat.\nIts species name \"parvus\" is Latin for \"small,\" chosen because of its extraordinarily small size compared to other species in its genus.",
    "Description": "It is the smallest member of its genus.\nIts forearm length is 44.7–48.1 mm (1.76–1.89 in).\nIts fur is beige or brownish-gray in color.",
    "Range and habitat": "It has been documented in Yemen and Oman.",
    "Conservation": "As of 2017, it is evaluated as a data deficient species by the IUCN.\nIt meets the criteria for this classification because there is inadequate data on its geographic range and biology.\nHowever, its known range is restricted.\n\n\n== References =="
