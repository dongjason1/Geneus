    "__SUMMARY__": "The Javan Tailless Fruit Bat (Megaerops kusnotoi) is a species of megabat in the family Pteropodidae. It is endemic to Indonesia.\nThe consumption of bushmeat, meat from undomesticated animals, is a big ecological problem in Indonesia, and a threat to bat biodiversity. \"Locals eat bats at least once a month, but the frequency increases tenfold around Christian holidays. Approximately 500 metric tons of bats are imported from other provinces, with South Sulawesi, Indonesia as the main provider at 38%.\" These high levels of excessive hunting and consumption of bats has made them become the most endangered species in Indonesia.\n\n\n== References =="
