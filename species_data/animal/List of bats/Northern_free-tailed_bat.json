    "Taxonomy and etymology": "It was described as a new species in 1873 by Irish zoologist George Edward Dobson.\nDobson had obtained the holotype from James Wood-Mason.\nDobson initially placed it in the genus Molossus and the subgenus Nyctinomus, with a scientific name of Molossus (Nyctinomus) johorensis.\nIts species name \"johorensis\" is Latin for \"belonging to Johor.\"\nJohor is a state in Malaysia; the holotype was collected there.",
    "Description": "Its ears are large and round.\nIts tragi are small and squarish in shape.\nIts ears are connected to each other by a band of tissue called the interaural membrane.\nAs a free-tailed bat, its tail extends beyond the uropatagium.\nIts dental formula is 2.1.2.34.1.2.3, for a total of 36 teeth.",
    "Conservation": "It is currently listed as vulnerable by the IUCN.\nIt meets the criteria for this designation because its population have declined by more than 30% from 2004–2014.\n\n\n== References =="
