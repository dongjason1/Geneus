    "__SUMMARY__": "The Sulawesi harpy fruit bat (Harpyionycteris celebensis) is a species of megabat in the family Pteropodidae. It is endemic to Indonesia.\n\n\"This species occurs in Sulawesi, Indonesia. It is also found in Soloi on Buton island in Indonesia. It occurs from sea level up to 2,120m asl or probably higher. This species is not common. In 2002, three individuals were captured at a single locality. Population Trend ↓ Decreasing. It seems to require good forest, but has also been recorded from cocoa plantations. Soloi individuals were caught over a river in undisturbed forest. Roosting habits are not known, but this species is not likely to be a cave dweller. Hunting for sale at market, and forest loss due to expanding agriculture and logging represent major threats to this species. This species is known to occur in Domoga-bone National Park.\"",
