    "Taxonomy": "Eger's long-fingered bat was described as a new species in 2011 by Goodman et al.\nThe eponym for the species name \"egeri\" is Judith Eger, Senior Curator of Royal Ontario Museum's Department of Mammalogy.",
    "Description": "Eger's long-fingered bat is a relatively small member of its genus with a forearm length of 37–40 mm (1.5–1.6 in).\nIndividuals weigh 4.2–7.6 g (0.15–0.27 oz).\nIt has a dental formula of 2.1.2.33.1.3.3 for a total of 36 teeth.",
    "Range and habitat": "Eger's long-fingered bat is endemic to Madagascar.\nIt has been documented at a range of elevations, from 5–1,300 m (16–4,265 ft) above sea level.",
    "Conservation": "As of 2017, it is evaluated as a least-concern species by the IUCN—its lowest conservation priority.\nIt meets the criteria for this classification because it has been detected in many sites, some of which are protected areas. Additionally, it is not dependent upon forested habitat, and can presumably tolerate land use change such as deforestation.\n\n\n== References =="
