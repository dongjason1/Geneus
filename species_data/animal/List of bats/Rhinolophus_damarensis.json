    "__SUMMARY__": "The Damara horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus damarensis, is a species of bat found in Africa.",
    "Taxonomy and etymology": "It was described as a subspecies of Darling's horseshoe bat in 1946 by South African zoologist Austin Roberts.\nIt was largely maintained as a subspecies of Darling's horseshoe bat until 2013, when it was shown to be genetically distinct.\nIts species name \"damarensis\" means \"belonging to Damara.\" \nRoberts was possibly referencing Damaraland in Namibia.",
    "Biology and ecology": "It is nocturnal, roosting in sheltered places during the day such as caves and mines, particularly asbestos and gold mines.\nIt is a social species, forming colonies that generally consist of fewer than 100 individuals.",
    "Range and habitat": "It is found in the eastern half of Southern Africa, with its range including Angola, Namibia, and South Africa.",
    "Conservation": "It is currently assessed as least concern by the IUCN—its lowest conservation priority.\nIt meets the criteria for this assessment category because it has a large geographic range, as well as a population size of approximately 20,000 adults.\nPotential threats to this species include habitat loss; the old mines that it uses as roosts are subject to disturbance if and when they are reopened.\nIts range includes protected areas, such as ǀAi-ǀAis/Richtersveld Transfrontier Park and Augrabies Falls National Park.\n\n\n== References =="
