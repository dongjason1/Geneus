    "__SUMMARY__": "The New Georgian monkey-faced bat (Pteralopex taki) is a recently described species of megabat endemic to the Solomon Islands, more specifically New Georgia and Vangunu Islands. It is presumably extinct on Kolombangara Island, and remaining population on other islands are threatened by habitat loss and hunting. Consequently, it is considered vulnerable by IUCN. In 2013, Bat Conservation International listed this species as one of the 35 species of its worldwide priority list of conservation.\n\n\n== References =="
