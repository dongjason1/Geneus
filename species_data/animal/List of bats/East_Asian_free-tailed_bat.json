    "__SUMMARY__": "The East Asian free-tailed bat (Tadarida insignis) was formerly considered a synonym of the European free-tailed bat. Its range includes China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula.",
    "Taxonomy": "It was described as a new species in 1862 by English zoologist Edward Blyth.\nThe holotype had been collected by Robert Swinhoe.\nBlyth placed it in the now-defunct genus Nyctinomus with a binomial of N. insignis.\nIn 1873, George Edward Dobson published that he considered it a synonym of Nyctinomus cestonii, which itself was deemed a synonym of the European free-tailed bat (N. teniotis, now Tadarida teniotis) by Oldfield Thomas.",
    "Description": "It has a forearm length of 57–65 mm (2.2–2.6 in).",
    "Biology and ecology": "It is known to roost in caves.\nIt has long, narrow wings.",
    "Range and habitat": "It is known from several countries in Asia including China, North and South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan.",
    "Conservation": "As of 2019, it is evaluated as a data deficient species by the IUCN.\nIt meets the criteria for this classification because it is a poorly-studied species; little is known about its biology, ecology, population size and trend, nor threats that it is facing.\nIt is presumably threatened by the destruction of its roosts.\nCave roosting habitat is lost due to cave tourism and stone quarrying.\n\n\n== References =="
