    "__SUMMARY__": "Rosevear's serotine (Neoromicia roseveari) is a species of vesper bat that lives in Guinea and Liberia. It was described as a new species in 2013. It is listed as endangered by the IUCN.",
    "Taxonomy and etymology": "It was described in 2013.\nIts closest relative is the dark-brown serotine, Neoromicia brunnea.\nRosevear's serotine and the dark-brown serotine are separated by a genetic distance of 6.9–7.2%.\nThe new species was assigned to the genus Neoromicia based on its single upper premolar: a trait shared amongst all species in the genus.\nThe authors who described the species chose the specific epithet \"roseveari\" to honor Donovan Reginald Rosevear, \"who made a significant contribution to West African bat research in the 20th century, culminating in his book The Bats of West Africa\".",
    "Description": "It is a small bat, with a total body length of 89–91 mm (3.5–3.6 in).\nIts tail is 39–44 mm (1.5–1.7 in); its forearm is 37 mm (1.5 in) long; its hindfoot is 8 mm (0.31 in) long; its ear length is 13–14 mm (0.51–0.55 in).\nIt has a body mass of 6–6.3 g (0.21–0.22 oz).\nIts maximum skull length is 14.36–14.47 mm (0.565–0.570 in).\nDespite this small size, it is the largest \"pipistrelloid\" (bats in the genera Hypsugo, Neoromicia, and Pipistrellus) in West Africa.\nIn some aspects, Eisentraut's pipistrelle overlaps with Rosevear's serotine in size, though they can be differentiated by their morphology.\nIts fur is dark chocolate brown in color.\nThe fur on its ventral surface is bicolored, with the bases of individual hairs darker than their tips.\nThe fur on its dorsal surface is a constant color throughout, in contrast to the bicolored ventral fur.\nIts ear is relatively short, and rounded at the tip.\nThe outer edge of the tragus is curved; the base of the tragus has a \"distinct lobe.\"\nRelative to other species in its genus, it has a robust skull and a broad snout.\nIts dental formula, typical for Neoromicia species, is 2.1.1.23.1.3.3, for a total of 32 teeth.",
    "Biology": "As only six individuals have ever been encountered, very little is known about the biology of this species. A female captured in Guinea in early March 2008 was pregnant, however, with a fetus 20 mm (0.79 in) from crown to rump.",
    "Range and habitat": "Only six specimens have ever been documented.\nFour specimens were recorded on the Liberian border of Mount Nimba and the other two specimens were in the Simandou Range of Guinea.\nAll captured individuals were netted over small streams in primary rainforest.\nTwo of the Mount Nimba individuals were encountered at 450–550 m (1,480–1,800 ft) above sea level.",
    "Conservation": "It is currently evaluated as endangered by the IUCN.\nIt meets the criteria for this designation because its extent of occurrence is estimated at less than 5,000 km2 (1,900 sq mi) and its area of occupancy is estimated at less than 500 km2 (190 sq mi).\nMajor threats to this species include deforestation via slash-and-burn agriculture, logging, and mining.",
