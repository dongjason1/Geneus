    "__SUMMARY__": "Conus ochroleucus, common name the prefect cone,  is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of \"stinging\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.\n\nSubspecies\nConus ochroleucus ochroleucus Gmelin, 1791\nConus ochroleucus tmetus Tomlin, 1937 (synonyms : Asprella ochroleuca tmetus (Tomlin, J.R. le B., 1937); Conus pilkeyi Petuch, 1974; Conus sulciferus A. Adams, 1855; Phasmoconus pilkeyi Petuch, E.J., 1974)",
    "Description": "The size of an adult shell varies between 40mm and 88mm. The shell is long and narrow, distantly grooved towards the base.
