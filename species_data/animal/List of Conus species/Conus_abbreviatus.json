They are capable of \"stinging\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully.",
    "Description": "The shell of this species has spots which are more distant from one another and somewhat more regularly disposed than in Conus miliaris.",
    "Distribution": "This species occurs off the Hawaiian Islands.",
    "Ecology": "Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of \"stinging\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.",
