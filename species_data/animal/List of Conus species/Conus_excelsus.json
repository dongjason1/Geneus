    "__SUMMARY__": "Conus excelsus, common name the excelsior cone or the illustrious cone, is a species of predatory sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails.",
    "Shell description": "The shell has a very high spire, with a size varying between 28 mm and 102 mm, compared to most cone shells, and thus it is exceptionally long relative to its width. This, combined with its overall rarity, makes it desirable to shell collectors.\nThe shell coloration consists of orangish to yellow patterns against a white background.",
    "Distribution": "Conus excelsus is an Indo-Pacific species found principally around the Philippines, but also as north as southern Japan and as far east as New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. it also occurs off Queensland, AustraliaThe species is rare but not endangered.",
