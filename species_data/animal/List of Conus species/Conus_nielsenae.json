    "__SUMMARY__": "Conus nielsenae, common name Nielsen's cone, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of \"stinging\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.",

For conservation evaluation, all three are here listed as distinct.The subspecies Conus nielsenae reductaspiralis Walls, 1979 is a synonym of Conus reductaspiralis Walls, 1979",
    "Description": "The size of the shell varies between 28 mm and 55 mm.",
    "Distribution": "This marine species occurs off the Kermadec Islands and off Australia (New South Wales, Queensland).",
