    "__SUMMARY__": "Conus adamsonii, common name the rhododendron cone, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of \"stinging\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.\nThe epithet adamsonii commemorates Robert Stephen Adamson.",
    "Description": "The size of the shell varies between 26.4 mm and 56 mm. The spire is depressed, channeled and striate. The body whorl is grooved above and below, smooth in the middle. The color of the shell is rosy white, with numerous small triangular chestnut spots and three bands of violaceous and chestnut clouds and reticulations.",
    "Distribution": "This marine species occurs off the Marquesas Islands.",
