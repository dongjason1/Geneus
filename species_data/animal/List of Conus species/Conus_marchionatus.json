    "__SUMMARY__": "Conus marchionatus, common name the Marquesas cone, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of \"stinging\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.",
    "Description": "The size of the shell varies between 12 mm and 68 mm. The spire is depressed and shows spiral striae. Its color is yellowish or light brown, with large white rounded triangular spots. The pattern of coloring is very like Conus marmoreus, but lighter. The shell is immediately distinguished by the want of the coronal of tubercles and its usually small size.",
    "Distribution": "This species occurs in the Pacific Ocean off the Marquesas.",
