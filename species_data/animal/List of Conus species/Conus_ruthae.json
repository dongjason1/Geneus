    "__SUMMARY__": "Conus ruthae is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails, cone shells or cones.These snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of \"stinging\" human by means of a small harpoon-like venomous stinger extruded through the shell opening. \nThe threat by snails to humans is limited as the primary habitat of the snails is in deeper waters (20-100m), so contact with humans other than divers is minimized.",
    "Description": "The size of the shell varies between 40 mm and 54 mm.",
    "Distribution": "This marine species occurs off the Philippines.",
