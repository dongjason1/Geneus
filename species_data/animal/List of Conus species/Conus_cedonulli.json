    "__SUMMARY__": "Conus cedonulli is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of \"stinging\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.\nBeing a very varied species-complex, there has been much confusion in the course of years about which species and subspecies to assign to the Conus cedonulli-complex, hence the number of synonyms named.  In 1985 D.L.N. Vink proposed assigning the following species to the Conus cedonulli-complex along with Conus cedonulli :\nConus aurantius Hwass  in Bruguière,  1792\nConus insularis  Gmelin,  1791 : considered by Vink to be a synonym of Conus aurantius Hwass in Bruguière, 1792\nConus mappa  sensu Lightfoot,  1786\nConus sanctaemarthae spec. nov. : now synonym of Conus mappa sensu Lightfoot, 1786The following subspecies of Conus cedonulli were recognized by the World Register of Marine Species:\n\nConus cedonulli dominicanus Hwass in Bruguière, 1792: synonym of Conus dominicanus Hwass in Bruguière, 1792\nConus cedonulli insularis Gmelin, 1791: synonym of Conus cedonulli Linnaeus, 1767",
    "Description": "The color of the species in this complex is white to purplish grey although specimens from St. Vincent are very often dark-mahogany-brown, with some rare examples being 'black' or near-black. The shell is crossed by streaks that are alternately light and dark. Between these streaks yellow, brown or dark dots occur. The operculum is small compared to the aperture and is only one seventh its size. The soft body of the animal is dark red.The size of an adult shell varies between 38 mm and 78 mm.",
    "Distribution": "This species occurs in the Caribbean Sea from Colombia to Trinidad, along the Lesser Antilles and along the Bahamas. Off West coast BARBADOS, the species has been dredged at depths around 85 fathoms/510 feet.  This would appear to be the species' bathymetric maximum, since at other locations the species is usually found at much shallower depths.",
