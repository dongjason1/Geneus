    "__SUMMARY__": "Conasprella aphrodite is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of \"stinging\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.",
    "Description": "The size of the shell varies between 15 mm and 24 mm. Their shell shape and design may differ, but will always be a cone shape. Their shell colors will vary from a light brown with white flecks to all black.\nWhen these snails feel threatened, they can shoot poison from their mouths that are in the shape of needles.",
    "Distribution": "This marine species occurs off the Philippines, New Caledonia and the Ryukyus, Japan.",
