    "__SUMMARY__": "Conus encaustus, common name the burnt cone,  is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of \"stinging\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.",
    "Description": "The size of an adult shell varies between 21.1 mm and 35 mm. The  spire is depressed, grooved and coronated with tubercles. The  body whorl has distant punctured grooves, more strongly and closely grooved towards the base. The color of the shell is clouded with chocolate- and ash-color, and encircled with numerous chocolate and white spots in lines. The aperture is purplish.",
    "Distribution": "This marine species is endemic to the Marquesas Islands.",
