    "__SUMMARY__": "Conus nimbosus, common name the stormy cone,  is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of \"stinging\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.\n\nSubspecies\nConus nimbosus nanoclarus Bozzetti, 2017 (off Madagascar)",
    "Description": "The size of an adult shell varies between 33 mm and 65 mm. The color of the rather smooth shell is rosy or violaceous white, with two faint chestnut bands, closely encircled by lines of small chocolate dots. The body whorl shows close revolving grooves.
