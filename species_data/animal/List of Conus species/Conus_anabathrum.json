They are capable of \"stinging\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.\nThere are  three subspecies :\n\nConus anabathrum anabathrum Crosse,1865: alternate representation of Conus anabathrum\nConus anabathrum antoni Cargile, 2011: synonym of Conus burryae Clench, 1942\nСonus anabathrum tranthami Petuch, 1998: synonym of Gradiconus anabathrum tranthami (Petuch, 1998) accepted as Conus burryae Clench, 1942",
    "Distribution": "This species occurs in the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico",
    "Description": "The maximum recorded shell length is 51 mm. The spire is elevated, and gradate. The body whorl is grooved towards the base.
