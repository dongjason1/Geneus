    "__SUMMARY__": "Conus erythraeensis, common name the Red Sea cone, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of \"stinging\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.",
    "Description": "The size of the shell varies between 16 mm and 35 mm. The shell is small, smooth and striate below. It is yellowish white, with revolving rows of quadrangular chestnut spots, sometimes partly clouded over, so as to form bands of chestnut clouds. The spire is maculate.",
    "Distribution": "This species occurs in the Red Sea and in the Northwest Indian Ocean.",
