They are capable of \"stinging\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.\n\nSubspecies\nConus cancellatus capricorni Van Mol, Tursch & Kempf, 1967\nConus cancellatus finkli Petuch, 1987",
    "Distribution": "This species occurs in the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and the Lesser Antilles.",
    "Description": "The maximum recorded shell length is 80 mm.The pear-shaped shell is broad and angulated at the shoulder, contracted towards the base. The body whorl is closely sulcate throughout, the sulci striate. The intervening ridges are rounded. The spire carinate and concavely elevated. Its apex is acute and striate.
