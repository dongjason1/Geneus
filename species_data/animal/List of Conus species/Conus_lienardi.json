    "__SUMMARY__": "Conus lienardi or Lienard's cone is a species of sophisticated predatory sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails, cone shells or cones.\n \nLike all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of \"stinging\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.",
    "Distribution": "This is an Indo-Pacific species, occurring in Melanesia and off New Caledonia.",
    "Shell description": "The size of the shell varies between 24 mm and 63 mm . The spire is raised, carinated and slightly striate. The body whorl is distantly grooved below. The color of the shell is yellowish brown, variously longitudinally covered with zigzag chestnut or chocolate markings; sometimes almost or quite covered with chocolate.",
