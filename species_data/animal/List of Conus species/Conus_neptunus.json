They are capable of \"stinging\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.",
    "Description": "The size of an adult shell varies between 43 mm and 80 mm. The solid shell is narrow, with a concavely elevated spire and a sharp apex. The body whorl is distantly grooved towards the base. The shell has a  flesh color, everywhere veined and clouded with reddish chestnut flexuous lines and spots. The aperture is rosy white.",
    "Distribution": "This species occurs off the Philippines, Australia and in the Southwest Pacific Ocean.",
