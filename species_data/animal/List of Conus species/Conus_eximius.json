    "__SUMMARY__": "Conus eximius, common name the exceptional cone or the choice cone, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of \"stinging\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.",
    "Description": "The size of an adult shell varies between 22 mm and 58 mm. The shell is ovately conical and rather solid. The spire is broadly channeled and at the base distantly grooved. The color of the shell is white, with rust-brown flexuous longitudinal flames, and a white central band, with revolving row of spots.",
    "Distribution": "This marine species occurs from the Bay of Bengal to Papua New Guinea, off the Philippines,  Taiwan and Queensland, Australia.",
