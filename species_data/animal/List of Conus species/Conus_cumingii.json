They are capable of \"stinging\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.\nThis species is not to be confused with Conus cumingii Reeve, L.A., 1849, an invalid junior homonym and synonym of Conus virgatus Reeve, 1849 .",
    "Description": "The size of the shell varies between 20 mm and 40 mm.",
    "Distribution": "This marine species occurs off India, Sri Lanka, Western Thailand, Indonesia, the Southern Philippines and the Solomon Islands.",
