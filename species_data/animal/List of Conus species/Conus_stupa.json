    "__SUMMARY__": "Conus stupa is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of \"stinging\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.",
    "Description": "The size of the shell varies between 43 mm and 100 mm.\nConus Stupa, members of the order Neogastropoda are mostly gonochoric and broadcast spawners. Their life cycle consists of embryos developing into planktonic trochophore larvae and later into juvenile veligers before becoming fully grown adults.",
    "Distribution": "This marine species occurs from Vietnam and the Philippines to Japan; off the Solomon Islands and the Loyalty Islands.",
