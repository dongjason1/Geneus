    "__SUMMARY__": "Conus algoensis, common name the algoa cone, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of \"stinging\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.\nThere are four subspecies :\n\nConus algoensis algoensis Sowerby, G.B. I, 1834 (synonym: Conus algoensis agulhasi Coomans, Moolenbeek & Wils, 1980)\nConus algoensis norpothi Lorenz, 2015 (alternate representation: Conus (Sciteconus) algoensis norpothi Lorenz, 2015)\nConus algoensis scitulus Reeve, 1849 (synonym: Conus scitulus Reeve, 1849)\nConus algoensis simplex Sowerby, G.B. II, 1857 (synonym: Conus simplex G. B. Sowerby II, 1858 )",
