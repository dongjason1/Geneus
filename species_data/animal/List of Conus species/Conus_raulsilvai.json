They are capable of \"stinging\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.",
    "Description": "The size of the shell varies between 17 mm and 25 mm.",
    "Distribution": "This species occurs in the Atlantic Ocean in Cape Verde. It is known only from Maio Island, from shallow water. It must be an insular endemic, and it is a species at high risk of extinction.",
