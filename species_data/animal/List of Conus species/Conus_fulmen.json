    "__SUMMARY__": "Conus fulmen, common name the thunderbolt cone,  is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of \"stinging\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.",

The color of the shell is pale rose-purple, white round the middle ;\nlongitudinally marked with two or three very prominent, broad, waved, purple-brown streaks. The spire is obtusely convex, variegated\nwith purple-brown. The apex is rose-tinted.",
