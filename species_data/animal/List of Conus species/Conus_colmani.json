    "__SUMMARY__": "Conus colmani is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of \"stinging\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.",
    "Taxonomy": "Conus colmani is part of a species complex including Conus albellus, Conus lizardensis and Conus limpusi, that needs re-evaluation. For conservation implications, all are here tentatively listed as distinct species.",
    "Description": "The size of an adult shell varies between 35 mm and 52 mm.",
    "Distribution": "This marine species is endemic to Australia and is found off Queensland.",
