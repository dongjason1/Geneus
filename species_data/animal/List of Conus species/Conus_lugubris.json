    "__SUMMARY__": "Conus lugubris is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of \"stinging\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.",
    "Description": "The size of the shell varies between 10 mm and 24 mm. The shell is finely striated, rudely ridged at the base with the ridges few and distant. The spire is conspicuously grooved. Its color is chocolate-black, obscurely reticulated here and there with numerous aggregated small white spots.",
    "Distribution": "This species occurs only on the north coast of the island of São Vicente, Cape Verde.",
