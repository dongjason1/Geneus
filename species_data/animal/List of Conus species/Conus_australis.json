    "__SUMMARY__": "Conus australis, common name the austral cone, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of \"stinging\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.",
    "Description": "The size of the shell varies between 40 mm and 123 mm. The shell is distantly channeled throughout. The interstices are usually plane, sometimes minutely granular. The channels are narrow and longitudinally striated. The spire is much elevated, acuminated, striate, sometimes obscurely minutely coronated. The color of the shell is yellowish brown, with light chestnut longitudinal short irregular lines, and clouds of the same color forming three obscure interrupted bands.",
    "Distribution": "This marine species occurs off Japan and in the South China Sea; also off New Caledonia and the Philippines.",
