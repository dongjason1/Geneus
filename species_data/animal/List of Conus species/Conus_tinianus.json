    "__SUMMARY__": "Conus tinianus, common name the variable cone, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails and their allies.Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of \"stinging\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.",
    "Description": "The size of the shell varies between 20 mm and 60 mm. The thin shell is striated towards the base. Its color is reddish chestnut clouded with gray, and irregularly ornamented with indistinct fillets of articulated white and chestnut. The spire is obtusely convex. The apex is rose-tinted.",
    "Distribution": "This marine species occurs off the east coast of South Africa.",
