    "Distribution and habitat": "This small cone snail is unusual, most species are tropical whereas this species lives in the cooler, temperate waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean, including most of the coast of California. The range of this species is from the Farallon Islands near San Francisco to Bahia Magdalena, in Baja California, Mexico. [1]\nThis cone is found in both rocky and sandy areas, in the intertidal zone and subtidally down to 30 meters depth. [2]",
