    "__SUMMARY__": "The Saint Helena cuckoo (Nannococcyx psix) is an extinct bird. It was confirmed to have previously existed by a single humerus. Compared to other cuckoos, it was relatively small, and it probably lived in forests on the island of Saint Helena. Its extinction was a result of deforestation on the island in the 18th century.",
