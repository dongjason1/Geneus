    "__SUMMARY__": "Hawkins' rail or the giant Chatham Island rail, Diaphorapteryx hawkinsi, was a flightless extinct bird endemic to the Chatham Islands south of New Zealand. It is known to have existed only on the main islands of Chatham Island and Pitt Island. It is largely known from skeletal remains found in the kitchen middens of the original Polynesian inhabitants, the Moriori.\nThe bird was approximately 16 inches (410 mm) tall and weighed about 4.5 pounds (2.0 kg) and is thought to have been primarily an insectivore.\nHenry Ogg Forbes originally placed the bird in the same genus as the red rail of Mauritius, Aphanapteryx, but later moved it to its own genus.It was long thought that the Hawkins' rail was extinct prior to European discovery, however recent evidence suggests that the bird may have become extinct much later. An 1895 letter belonging to financier/zoologist Walter Rothschild describes the appearance, behaviour, and Moriori hunting method concerning the species.",
