    "__SUMMARY__": "The Tahiti reed warbler (Acrocephalus caffer) is a songbird in the genus Acrocephalus. It used to be placed in the \"Old World warbler\" assemblage (Sylviidae), but is now in the newly recognized marsh warbler family Acrocephalidae. It is endemic to the island of Tahiti.\nMost taxonomists regard Garrett's reed warbler and the Moorea reed warbler as distinct. They used to be considered subspecies.\nAs a whole, the Tahiti reed warbler was classified as a vulnerable species by the IUCN. But new research has shown it to be rarer than it was believed. Consequently, it was uplisted to endangered status in 2008.",
