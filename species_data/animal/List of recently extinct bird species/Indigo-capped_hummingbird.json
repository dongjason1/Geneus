A turquoise-capped form known only from the Miravalles Volcano in Costa Rica may represent a separate subspecies or even species, the Miravalles or Alfaro's hummingbird (Amazilia alfaroana), but its exact status is difficult to judge",
    "Description": "It has an indigo cap. Its body is emerald green and its back is dark brown.\nIts natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest, subtropical or tropical moist montane forest, and heavily degraded former forest.\n\n\n== References =="
