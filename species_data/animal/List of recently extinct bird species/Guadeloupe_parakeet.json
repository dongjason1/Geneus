    "__SUMMARY__": "The Guadeloupe parakeet (Psittacara labati) might have been a species of parrot that was endemic to Guadeloupe.\n\n \nJean-Baptiste Labat described a population of small parrots living on Guadeloupe:\n\nThose of Guadaloupe are about the size of a blackbird, entirely green, except a few small red feathers, which they have on their head. Their bill is white. They are very gentle, loving, and learn to speak easily.\nThey were later named Conurus labati, and are now called the Guadeloupe parakeet (Psittacara labati). It has been postulated to be a separate species based on little evidence. There are no specimens or remains of the extinct parrots. Their taxonomy may never be fully elucidated, and so their postulated status as a separate species is hypothetical.It is presumed to have gone extinct in the late 18th century, if it did indeed exist.\n\n\n== References =="
