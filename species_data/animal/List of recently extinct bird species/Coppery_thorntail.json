    "__SUMMARY__": "Letitia's thorntail (Discosura letitiae), also known as the coppery thorntail, is a species of hummingbird in the family Trochilidae.  It is only known from two old male specimens from Bolivia (though localities for old skins often are unreliable, and it is possible they came from elsewhere). Consequently, its behavior and habitat are unknown, but likely similar to that of other thorntails. It has been suggested that it represented a hybrid or a variant of the racquet-tailed coquette, but a study has validated its status as a distinct species.\n\n\n== References =="
