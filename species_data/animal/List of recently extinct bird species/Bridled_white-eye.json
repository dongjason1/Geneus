    "__SUMMARY__": "The bridled white-eye (Zosterops conspicillatus) (Chamorro name: nosa') is a species of bird in the family Zosteropidae. It is endemic to the Northern Mariana Islands, where the one remaining subspecies is currently abundant on the islands of Tinian, Saipan and Aguijan. The bridled white-eye natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, plantations, and rural gardens.\nThe nominate subspecies formerly occurred on the island of Guam, but that population is almost certainly now extinct due in large part to the invasive and non-native brown tree snake consuming both adults, nestlings, and eggs. The remaining subspecies (Z. c. saypani) is now also projected to undergo a rapid population decline due to the recent introduction of the brown tree snake on Saipan. Formerly, the Rota white-eye was also considered as a subspecies of the bridled white-eye.\n\n\n== References =="
