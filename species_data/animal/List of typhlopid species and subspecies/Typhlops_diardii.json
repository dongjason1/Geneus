    "__SUMMARY__": "Argyrophis diardii, known commonly as Diard's blind snake, the Indochinese blind snake, the large blind snake, or the large worm snake, is a species of harmless snake in the family Typhlopidae. The species is endemic to South Asia and Southeast Asia. There are two recognized subspecies.",
    "Geographic range": "A. diardii is distributed in India (Jalpaiguri-West Bengal, as far west as Dun Valley in Assam), Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, the Malay Peninsula, Nias Island, Sumatra, Web Island (off northwest Sumatra), Bangka, and Borneo.",
    "Etymology": "Both the specific name, diardii, and the common name, \"Diard's blindsnake\", are in honor of French naturalist Pierre-Médard Diard.",
    "Taxonomy": "A. diardii was first described by Hermann Schlegel in 1839, as Typhlops Diardii. The type locality of Schlegel's specimen was \"Cochinchina [southern Vietnam]\". Saint Girons (1972: 32) described it as \"Cochinchina sans certitude [southern Vietnam without certainty]\", and Hahn (1980: 56) as \"East Indies\".Two subspecies of Typhlops diardii are recognized as being valid, including the nominotypical subspecies:\nArgyrophis diardii diardii Schlegel, 1839\nArgyrophis diardii platyventris Khan, 1998",
